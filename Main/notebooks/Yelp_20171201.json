I had another appointment for Thursday at another place, but i saw she was really ill.  I contacted Lavista animal hospital to see if they had a Avian vet.  They said they do and that she also has a mobile vet service and would come to me.  I called Dr Tobias to see if she could see my bird and told her I didn't have a lot of money but wanted to do what i could to see what's wrong with her and to make her comfortable.  When i talked to her she asked me to bring the bird in and I said Ok.  I asked her how much it would cost.  She told me the exam would be $65.00 I said okay.  Let me tell you about my horror story.  I arrived at Lavista animal hospital around 5:35pm  My Budgie was at the bottom of the cage with rapid breathing and very very fluffed (signs of a dying bird) She also had a swollen bald bottom.   I was thinking maybe egg bound.  She takes her out the cage and looks at her bottom.  Sticks a long Q Tip in her bottom.  She's squeaking every time she does it.   She saids she doesn't think she is eggbound and told me she was going to give her an x-ray, didn't ask if I wanted an x-ray just took her off and supposedly did it.  (5 MINUTES) later.  I mean just 5 minutes later, she comes back and says there's no egg or mass in her bottom (never showed me an x-ray) and says she gave her shot inside her wing (never asked me if she could), gave her an antibiotic (never asked me if she could) and gave her a lube inside her cloaca.  When my bird was put back in the cage she was far worse then when i bought her in.  She died around 2am that night.  I was charged $85.00 for exam (told it would be 65) X-ray 65.00, shot $25.00 antibiotic tabs 28.00, Lube cloaca $1.96.

The behavioral health person at the hospital indicated that during the 72 hour hold, he would be receiving group and individual therapy.  He was also told that his special dietary needs (due to a food allergy) could be accomodated and that Peachford had a chef who would provide meals he could eat.  The person who did the initial intake was efficient and once that was complete, family members had to leave.  At this point, he was taken to the unit and assigned to a room.  He was told that he would see the psychiatrist who would be treating him within a couple of hours.  He also had a newly stitched wound that should have received medical attention throughout his stay.  He was provided a meal during the intake process, however, once he was placed in a unit, he was only given the options in the cafeteria, which meant that he had very little to eat.  He did not see a psychiatrist that day (intake was on a Thursday morning about 9:00 a.m.), that night or the next morning.  His wound was not monitored.  Most disturbing, he was not given the anti-depressant medication that he was prescribed, even though stopping it abruptly was dangerous.  He attended various group therapy sessions, none of which were specific to what he was being treated for (depression) but were focused on substance abuse.  There was also a lot of religious propaganda in these sessions, although this hospital is not affiliated with a church of any kind.  He finally saw a physician that afternoon for literally two minutes.  The doctor looked at his information, did not look at the physical wound, did not release his regular medication to the nurses to give him, and told him that he would not receive any individual counseling because \"this is not that kind of facility.\"  That night, he was given medication that was not his regular meds, but an anti-psychotic because \"everyone has to take them.\"   We called his regular psychiatrist and reported what was happening to him; he was concerned about him not receiving his regular medication and going into withdrawal, and called the psychiatrist on staff to ask about this.  He was never contacted back by the hospital.  The next day passed without receiving medication and the entire family became extremely concerned.  He decided to request to be discharged against medical advice, which was a BIG mistake, as this simply gave them the right to hold him longer (more $$$).  He was also no longer allowed to eat meals in the cafeteria because his request was considered a danger for him to try to run away.  Still not receiving medication and being forced to take anti-psychotic.  Supposed to be getting a daily visit with the psychiatrist - one of these \"visits\" occurred in a hallway when our family member happened to run into the doctor.  When a visiting day came, we arrived and were directed to the wrong unit THREE TIMES by the staff at the lobby desk.  After four days without his prescribed medication, he was finally given it.  The wound had still not been monitored at all.    Four days after admitting, we were given an appointment (called family therapy - it's not) to get ready to release, but it was the weekend.  The doctor wouldn't release him that day.  FIve days after admitting, he was released.  \n\nThis hospitalization was a horrible experience for someone who was in need of help.  Basically, they hold your family member for a certain number of days without providing any treatment whatsoever.  (If you don't have insurance, they will send you home, however.)  It was of no help at all.  We were fortunate afterward to get good help after the hospitalization, which helped tremendously, but this could have been an experience that made the entire situation worse.  The staff were mostly rude and often seemed incompetent.  The social worker who did the release \"family therapy\" was nice, but she basically asked a bunch of questions that were a legal \"cover your ass\" for the hospital.  Dr. Naveed Ummed was rude and seemed uninterested in doing anything beyond checking the boxes he has to check to get his paycheck.  To say he has no bedside manner is an understatement.  \n\nI have to assume that Peachford is actually geared to treat people with substance abuse problems and I hope they do it better than they treat people with mental health issues.

First impression of the restaurant looks positive. \n\nOnce I am seated, I am greeted by my waiter who doesn't seem to know much English but she is kind enough.  She isn't chatty at all but she was not rude, just a tad indifferent.  She brings my water and gives me a moment to go over the menu.  The menu has so many traditional options as well as what appeared to be Chinese food options.  I settled on the Spring rolls and Pineapple Fried Rice.  Doesn't take long and the spring rolls arrive.  Delicious but small portion. Later, the Pineapple Fried Rice comes and its literally the rice in the pineapple! Love it! I had never seen that before and it did add a nice smile to my face.  The food was just as good as the presentation.  It came with peanuts on the top which I didn't like but that is on me since I didn't read the item description fully.  I simply pushed the peanuts to the side and went to town.  It was awesome.  \n\nI would definitely go back here again and try the other traditional thai options such as Pad Thai or Pad See Ew.  Only reason why this place doesn't give a full five stars was because my waitress was a little AWOL and I ended up having to call someone else to fill my water and bring more sauce.  The waitress definitely felt bad as she then began to hover near my table but at that point I was nearly done.  I know it seems harsh to knock a star for that but I keep it real with my reviews.  I am sure next time I go there, it won't happen again.  I look forward to coming back!","DateTime":1512086987000,"Time_Only":"00:09:47","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"0","Date_Minute":"9"}

My Tahoe has been at Henna for 5 weeks now (with no loaner car) to get the rear A\/C lines replaced: it took 2 weeks for someone to even look at the vehicle because Felix didn't bother answering calls or communicating after he'd told me at my appointment that it'd probably not be looked at for 2 days (the vehicle was looked at the same day that I got in touch with the service department manager Mark Wilson); another 1 week because of my third party warranty company; and now yet another 2 weeks because the mechanic works on it \"when he can.\" I'm told that he gets frustrated working on it and then works on something else. I'm sorry, but I have been paying for a month's car loan and insurance and getting no use out of it. I don't know why I didn't check online reviews (Facebook, Google, Yelp, etc.) before blindly taking my vehicle to Henna. The service department works hard to earn their overwhelmingly one-star reviews. In fact, I think my service advisor (Felix) has been mentioned the most in 1-star reviews. Frequently, the GM Mark Rowe responds to Yelp reviews with generic responses. For comparison, on Facebook and even Yelp, the number of 1-star reviews for Covert GMC is MUCH, MUCH lower, and many of them are responded to by the owner. Sometimes those reviews have a follow-up from the original poster saying \"resolved to my satisfaction.\" My wife and have had \"pleasant\" experiences obtaining service (including major service) for our various previous vehicles at dealerships ranging from Saturn to Covert GMC to Subaru of Austin to Maserati of Austin, and Henna has mind-blowingly, astoundingly poor customer service. If Felix had bothered to stay on top of the status of my vehicle and communicated from the start, I wouldn't be leaving this review. While still deployed a couple of months ago, I called initially to set up an appointment to bring my vehicle in, and I had to explain the desire to set up the appointment to three separate people before finally receiving an appointment. I later had to cancel that appointment because I was delayed in returning home, but I should have thought to check reviews given that incredibly inefficiency on the phone. In my opinion, Henna has one of three potential issues: 1) the dealership's acceptable service standard is to maintain a certain percentage of irate customers in order to minimize time spent on customers, 2) Felix is the worst project manager I've ever known (and I know a few incompetent ones), or 3) the service advisers are insanely busy and can't keep up. Any one of those three is the dealership's responsibility to fix if they want to have any repeat customers. Again to compare to Covert GMC, after my vehicle had been at Henna for 3 weeks I called Covert GMC up to find out the estimated time and cost to fix the A\/C lines. The lady who answered the phone took the time to speak with service advisors and parts personnel to give an accurate quote, and swore up and down that the only time a vehicle was lost in the shop for 2 weeks was when they had a service advisor quit on them. Again, this was done with Covert GMC knowing that the vehicle was already in the shop at Henna so they were unlikely to get the business. Based on my experience and many online reviews, Henna has set themselves up as the gold standard for amazingly horrible customer service in the service department. I guess they need the countless 5-star reviews for their sales department in order to stay in business. Or perhaps the \"little guy\" like me always gets pushed for the fleet service like TxDPS.","DateTime":1512087268000,"Time_Only":"00:14:28","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"0","Date_Minute":"14"}

I said I thought she was incorrect, she went back to check with the chef again, and came back with his message that miso isn't soy. I felt uncomfortable to even order sushi after that.","DateTime":1512088311000,"Time_Only":"00:31:51","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"0","Date_Minute":"31"}

I have been a fan of Peruvian food for some years now, having discovered the old Machu Picchu restaurant on Buford Highway. Most of the items on the menu were very familiar to me and we quickly chose the papa a la huancaina, pollo saltado, and the carapulcra. The carapulcra, or pork stew, was the only dish we had not had before. \nThe papa a la huancaina was good, but not great. The sauce seem slightly lacking in flavor. The presentation was great and the portion was generous. Pollo saltado is a favorite in our house and we had high expectations. Unfortunately, it was a bit too salty for our tastes. It wasn't bad, just a little too salty. The carapulcra, however, was a solid winner. Just a really nice, uniquely flavored stew with lots of flavorful pork. It cam e with rice and fried yucca. The yucca could not have been prepared better. \nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and the service was great. It's a nice addition to Tucker's restaurant scene.","DateTime":1512088346000,"Time_Only":"00:32:26","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"0","Date_Minute":"32"}

I'm especially allergic to gluten and dairy so I was excited YP had those options available like Maddios.\n\nFirst, we walked in and no one greeted us. We walked up to the station and no one was there, even though I saw the people in the back counter watch us walk in. A lady finally walked over and asked us what we want. \n\nI began to order a 7\" pizza for my grandma, who doesn't eat much and was probably going to throw out most of the 7\" pizza. The lady straight up said no... the conversation went like this...\n\nMe: Can I get a 7\" kids pizza\nLady: No I can't do that\nMe: Excuse me?\nLady: There's no kids around \nMe: My grandma is not going to eat a 10\" pizza, she's barely going to finish a 7\" pizza\nLady: But she's not a kid\nMe: I know that... but she will not eat a 10\" pizza alone. She barely eats, she's old. \n\nAnd his continued for a bit until she \"gave in\" and told the guy to make a kids cheese pizza... except for the fact that he had headphones in his ears and couldn't hear her. Instead of taking them off, they joked about it and he put them back in. \n\nMeanwhile, I was trying to order the next set of pizzas for me and my boyfriend because she kept rushing me and saying \"What else? What else do you want?\" before even starting the first pizza I ordered. \n\nBut each time I tried to order, she'd turn around to do something or say something to someone else and interrupted me mid-sentence each time I tried to order. \n\nHer: What else?\nMe: I'll have a gluten free...\nHer: (turns around to talk to someone else, then turns back to me) What else do you want?\nMe: Yes, I'll have a gluten free pizza with vegan...\nHer: (turns around and tells the other guy to make a kids pizza and turns back to me) Okay so you want white? White dough pizza?\nMe: No. I said I want gluten free dough\nHer: (turns around and walks away to the cashier and then comes back to me) What did you say you wanted?\n\nBy the 5th time she interrupted me (yes, 5th time) my boyfriend suggested we leave. Which to be honest, he's the patient one in the relationship so I was shocked when he made that suggestion. \n\nSo we told her and the other guy with the headphones never mind and walked right out. \n\nWe called Mellow Mushroom - they had gluten free and vegan cheese pizzas. We went there (which was down the street) and experienced way better customer service. \n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this Your Pie location. Hopefully the other locations have better service but I'm pretty doubtful after this experience.","DateTime":1512089354000,"Time_Only":"00:49:14","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"0","Date_Minute":"49"}

Szechwan spicy pork wontons ($7): I would've been content with just eating this for the night but I wanted soup, too. These are delicate, homemade wontons stuffed with pork. They're tender and slippery to grasp with chopsticks since they're soaking in their own sauce and oils. The sauce and oils give the wontons a juicy, soft texture and a mild sweet taste. There's 8 bite sized pieces enough to share evenly.\n\nB3. Hot & Spicy Noodle Soup ($10): This isn't a spicy dish either. A spicy sauce container sits at each table which helps increase the level since spicy turns out to be mild. The broth looks like it's going to hurt you later but it won't. The bowl contains a deceptively large quantity of hand-pulled noodles. Get this if you don't like thick noodles. Every ingredient from the noodles to pork to the baby bok choy tasted very good. I can't imagine eating this in one sitting but I'm sure someone has. It's a heavy meal.\n\nAll the appetizers are $7 and the noodle bowls are $10. There's flavored tea, milk tea, and hot tea to drink. If you sit near the entrance you can watch the noodles being made.\n\nService is something they could work on. Their impatience was noticed.

If you want good ramen near Chinatown, you can always go to Amateras which is not far away. They have good and cheap ramen there.

I am just not into quick hit, rapid fire, stove efficent pizzas. I've tried several of these fast-casual pizza places and I am just not impressed. So it is not this chain's or store's fault, It is alright like all the others, I am just not enamored with the concept; if I really want pizza I think I'll stick with the real thing. Probably idiosyncratic of me;I don't mean to dissuade; it is good enough for a three star. \n\nResiding in a gutted and well redone former BK in the curvey environs of Mill Run, they have reshaped the worn insides of the former to a spic & span space plotted out like a sports bar. My first time was on a lunch break and to catch the opening of Ohio State-Michigan since Yelp clued me on their TVs. I wanted to take ordering slowly--so I could get situated in a new environment and to get quickly updated on 'the game.' Unfortunately I felt very rushed by the clerk. She was almost frantic in speech and allowed me little time to get oriented asking me to approach the counter when as soon as I entered. My guess is there's some godawful metric in use judging employees on speed. If so not cool. If so management should reconsider that; metrics lead to fraud, stressed employees, low quality, and in this case a customer whose first interaction was slightly negative. \n\nI had a magic mushroom pizza-a pre-formulated option on the list of specialties, a fountain drink, and a coronary as Ohio State quickly went into 14-0 hole.  As for the pizza, which did come up fast ( it is counter served), I stuggle to explain my apathy without over criticizing it.  Hard to explain. Like all other like places I have experienced the toppings are fresh, the sauce is decent, the crust is bland but inoffensive. The best I can say is that it has no soul. Whatever that means. You eat it, it is there, you leave and forget. There is no belly warmth to say you had a good meal, no slight dopamine reward, no serotonin kick. I am not sure what it is. It is somewhat an exaggeration what I am going to say next but the phrase is in the ballpark;  it seems like your everyday GMC, school lunch pizza just with better topping and sauce. How that adds I don't know, but no fast-casual, single serving pizza places have wowed me yet. They all seem humdrum. \n\nThough if you like fast pizzas this place is fast, clean, and have good options. \n\nOptions? I wish Urban and staff would stop calling them.

The food is actually to die for and my hopes of weight loss die once I walk through the doors (though there are healthy options from what I've seen). I ordered the Big Floyd and holy smokes is it a good sandwich!  The fries were perfectly seasoned and from what my boyfriend said, the corn is also super delicious. There's a nice, but casual, atmosphere and the staff is super friendly and walks around the self seating tables to provide refills and take plates away. Great location as well! Right across the street from Guesthouse and other bars, so it is definitely worth going to after a drink or two (or anytime really).","DateTime":1512090336000,"Time_Only":"01:05:36","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"5"}

After eating I went to pay at the counter. A bit surprised that nobody came by with a check but that was ok.  \n\nHad a coupon for the dinner but the fine print said had a 2 drink minimum. Now the 1\/2 carafe was more expensive than ordering a couple of beers or glasses of wine but she would only count it as one drink.  She offered to discount the coupon price for 2 buffets which was still lower than the price of the single dinner discount.  My partner was quite angry.

Their calls go directly to voicemail and no one calls back. I assumed my booking was cancelled since I wasn't able to get a hold of anyone so I went in person. The young man who was the lone worker there was helpful as he recalled my name but said I had to make another online booking as he had called his manager. He informed me to email head office who is really the managers Mike's email address. \nI emailed him explaining the situation and how frustrated I was since the booking was supposed to be for three days away. His response was beyond unprofessional and so rude I can't believe he's the manager! I had sent a Google review which is under my married name and he called it \"fake!\" When I told him it's not as that account is under my ex-husbands name he replied \"lucky!\" Unbelievable! This was my email...\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nI had originally made an online booking through your site for a party of 5 on December 3rd at 3pm. I received a tentative booking and was called a few days before the booking to request down payment to secure the spot.\nI called back on five separate  occasions to provide my credit card payment and all times my call went straight to voicemail with no call backs! I went into your New Westminster location on December 30th at approximately 3:20pm to speak to someone in person since you don't seem to return calls or respond to emails! Prior to this I had made another online booking on Tuesday in case the original reservation was cancelled and no one responded to that email! The young gentlemen recalled my name and when I explained to him I had try to call on numerous occasions with no response he informed me due to your Langley location being closed for renovations they have been overwhelmed and not have been able to respond to calls! He called the manager who was of little help and then told me to email head office in hopes this situation will be rectified before the weekend!\nI have to say I have not at all been impressed with the level of customer service I have received or should I say not have received. It is inexcusable for a company to not respond to phone calls! It seems all calls go to voicemail with no one responding!\nThe only reason I am pursuing  this is that my son has been so looking to Planet Lazer to celebrate his10th Birthday with his friends. I sincerely hope you are able to resolve this matter!\nSincerely,\nRachel Kutney \n...this was his response \n\nWe have replied to both your google review and your emails\nCheck your junk folder\nYou do not have a booking with us nor will we accept one from you\nThis is a bogus email - much like your bogus google account - no need to reply to it, it isn't checked \n\nNice!","DateTime":1512090590000,"Time_Only":"01:09:50","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"9"}

It is seriously one the worst post sale experiences I've had in my lifetime. I bought a Rogue in 2016 and it has been next to impossible to even speak to someone in the service department let alone get service. Same thing in September when I tried to get nitrogen in the tires. There for 15 minutes. No one even acknowledged me let alone spoke to me nor did anyone come out to speak to the eight people before me. The receptionist in the sales room was not helpful and what a surprise the general manager wasn't there. This is the same experience I've had with each of my past visits. No one answers the phone and if they do they say hold on let me transfer you to the correct person\/department and then you are just left on an endlessly ringing line. If you get to leave a voice mail they don't call you back. The post sale experience has ensured I will never buy another Nissan from Clay Cooley and likely not at all. Interestingly when I left this review on facebook it didn't take the general manager more than twenty minutes to respond and offer help or at least he did so in a public comment. It remains unclear why you cant get that kind of response in person or on the phone. I'd drive to Dallas for an oil change before I'd step foot back in this dealership. I've since taken my Rogue to Town North Nissian. There is definite improvement in that they at least acknowledge you when you are physically there and they do answer the phone but even there my service rep didn't want to investigate the chirping\/rattling from the hatch. It's as if the Nissan service team members are not aware that every interaction with them is shaping the customers decision as to whether or not to purchase another Nissan in the future.

I said I brush twice a day with pea sized toothpaste. She said toothpaste is secondary it doesn't matter for a four year old. I said so how do you expect it to be clean then??? She needs a pea sized toothpaste. My daughter Literally sat In the chair for less than 2 minutes and the hygienist said your done Goodbye. I said excuse me?? I told her when you do a cleaning, first you have to take the X-rays then floss in between each tooth then clean each tooth meaning each surface of all the teeth then let her rinse and spit out then lastly you put the fluoride gel on. And make sure in between she doesn't swallow anything. Then she'll be all set. I made her do everything over. She said how do you know?? I said I'm in the dental field. Where??? I said tufts university pediatrics. I told her you did nothing for my daughter so I'm going to another dental office. She got scared and told me sit back down I didn't know you knew so much, sorry I didn't know you were in the dental field. If you weren't in the dental field you wouldn't have known I did nothing.. ugh!!! I said I am in the dental field that's why I'm so specific how to do the cleaning. and I made her do everything over. I said first floss, She yelled I did floss look at all the blood on the floss!!! I said what blood??  you flossed one tooth. Do it over please in all the teeth. She said with the same floss or different?? I said different. I said where's the dentist she said she's not here yet she takes a train in. Why you want to wait for her??

MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.\n\nOLD MAN RECORDS ME AT GOODLIFE SOVEREIGN METROTOWN, AND NOTHING WAS DONE THANKS TO BEN (CLUB MANAGER)\n\nOn November 20th, I was working out at Goodlife Metrotown when a stranger approached me and told me that there was an older man (50-60 years old) recording me on his phone as he walked by. When he pointed to which man it was, I recognized him immediately. The old man has been acting strange around me since I joined the gym. For example, he would come very close to me and start exercising. Sometimes he would just stand near me and often walk close to me when it was unnecessary to do so. The man already had me feeling uncomfortable.\n\nI told the front desk staff including a personal trainer what had happened, and they assured me that they would take care of it and talk to the older man. Fast forward 10 days later and the man was still getting too close and acting weird. And when we asked if he had been talked to, the staff said no... I told my boyfriend what happened, so he approached the man and got into an altercation with him (no violence). One of the managers notified me that they reviewed the tapes, and found the moment when the old man walked by me, with his phone pointed directly at me. They even found the stranger who caught him, and they said that they would talk to him too. They made it appear that they had enough evidence to ban the old man. I thought I was safe to come back to the gym...\n\nBut unfortunately, earlier today (November 30, 2017) my boyfriend and I were approached by the club manager, Ben. Ben said that he talked to the older man and he believed that the event didn't take place (despite video evidence, despite what his colleagues thought of the surveillance, and despite what the witness said). He said the video doesn't show any \"obvious\" filming and that he was siding with the older man. When I asked about the witness, Ben told me that he hasn't talked to the witness yet. He also told me that they would not be banning the old man, despite not talking to the witness. What's sickening is that he informed me that the older man feels uncomfortable at the gym because of my boyfriend. \n\nBen told us that to be able to continue training at Goodlife, we will have to remain civil with the old man. My stomach dropped as I heard that. I felt like I was slapped in the face. Called a liar. I felt like Ben was playing a cruel joke on me. I told Ben, right then and there, to cancel my membership. Instead of acting comforting, Ben didn't say anything, he just got up, walked to the computer and canceled my membership. The whole ordeal felt as if he was banning me; the girl who was recorded by a sick old man.\n\nThanks, Ben. Guys like you are the reason women feel so uncomfortable at gyms. It took me years to finally set foot in the gym, and now I've been kicked out of one. I can't imagine how many times the old man filmed me in the past. And it makes me feel sick thinking about what he was doing with the videos. \n\nLadies, please be very careful of your surroundings, when you feel uncomfortable, it's most likely for a good reason. This kind of stuff can happen to anyone.","DateTime":1512091137000,"Time_Only":"01:18:57","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"18"}

This bowl comes with Chinese mushrooms,corn ( I get extra),spring onion, a soft boiled egg and pork belly or tenderloin to accompany the wavy ramen noodles.

Tasting Counter welcomes pescetarians, vegetarians, and vegans.  Among the other tasting menu type restaurants I've been to (Chef's Fare @ Brooklyn Table, Feastly and LQ Foodings Pop-ups) Tasting Counter has truly curated an enjoyable, intimate dining experience.\n\nAs stated on their website, all tickets are inclusive of your meal, beverage pairings, tax & tip.  At $65\/person, dining at Tasting Counter was worth every penny.  You see your food prepared right before your eyes at a dining counter that seats up to 20, surrounding their prep kitchen where every dish is plated in front of you..  The venue also becomes a wine bar during certain non-tasting menu hours (Tuesdays 5pm-12:30am, Wed through Sat 10:30pm-12:30am) and no reservations are needed.  It is located near a brewery and a rock climbing gym.  The venue is very warm and inviting, with their wine collection on one side of the back wall, as well as their herb garden.\n\nUpon getting seated, Chef Ungar personally introduced himself to everyone seated around the counter in two's or three's and explained their philosophy of \"0 carbon, 50 local, 100 natural\".  They strive toward a zero carbon footprint, sourcing at least 50% of their products from within the state of Massachusetts and serving all natural foods and wines.  The 5 course lunch menu was very well paired with beverages (I chose wine), with a mix of English, Asian, and French flavors.  The chef and sommelier were very descriptive with the food and beverage, and engage every guest.  Truly a wonderful find during my time in Boston.\n\nTasting Counter Lunch Menu (11\/2017)\n\nWelcoming Bites\nMarscapone Puff, 'French Onion Soup' Bite (onion, gruyere, sourdough), Smoked ocean trout belly\n\nGremolata Dumplings\nSea urchin, hen of the woods, soured cream, preserved lemon\n\nSchisandra tea with pine nut\n\nEuropean Sea Bass\nPine mushroom, daikon radish, black olive\n\nChestnut Dessert\nhazelnut, date, duck liver, chocolate sorbet\n\nParting Morsels\nCanele - goat milk caramel & juniper\nCranberry fruit chew w\/ fennel sugar\nSunflower seed praline chocolate piece\n\nCan't wait to return to Tasting Counter for another dining experience or for their natural wine bar.  Highly recommend!","DateTime":1512091347000,"Time_Only":"01:22:27","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"22"}

They have three great established restaurants to choose from: Da Kine Poke, Gnarly Barley & 081 Wood Fired Pizza (an Anthony's Pizza affiliate)  as well as continuing the wonderful selection of beer and cocktails Frank & Steins was known for. \n\nA friend and I stopped in for happy hour on a Monday before a SAK comedy show. We had only been previously to Market for drinks. While the food service is walk up ordering, they give you a number and bring your order to your table. \n\nBenjamin came right over to our table, asked if we had been in before, explained the new concept, described in detail what each of the three restaurants had to offer, and made recommendations for each one. He was so friendly, knowledgeable, down-to-earth and genuinely treated us like we were friends in his place. He made me feel like we were the only ones there, even thought he had a full bar and a few other tables.  He was able to make spot on beer recommendations for me as I was very indecisive of what I wanted to try that night. My friend knew what she wanted from the cocktails, but he was also engaging with her on ingredients and selecting a second cocktail. \nHe checked back on us often and was still charismatic and efficient. \n\nWe ended up trying a few things and sharing as everything was very tempting from all of the restaurants. We split a Di Carne pizza from 081 Wood Fired Pizza, a grilled cheese, & a brisket taco from Gnarly Barley.\nThe pizza had pepperoni, salami, sausage, prosciutto, mozzarella & parmesan. It was very, very good. The wood fire cooking makes all the difference! The dough was not too thick enabling you to taste all the other flavors from the toppings. It was a good personal size or perfect for sharing if you want to try other food options or sides. \nThe grilled cheese was incredible! It's not your typical grilled cheese from childhood.  We asked for a recommendation and she made us a cheddar, blue cheese & swiss sandwich. I don't know what kind of bread it was, but the combination of the cheeses and the bread was fantastic! They also had several other sandwich options as well as soup, side salads and tacos. \nI tried the brisket taco from Gnarly Barley as well. The meat portion was very generous and had a great subtle smoky flavor. The pico didn't over power it and it was a perfect portion size. \nI only regret I didn't have room to try something from Da Kine Poke. I will definitely be back to try some of their fresh fish options or even fish tacos on taco Tuesday!\n\nOverall I was impressed with the quality and selection of food we tried as well as the much appreciated attentive, accommodating, effective and knowledgeable service we had from Benjamin.","DateTime":1512092047000,"Time_Only":"01:34:07","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"34"}

Despite it all they still manage to maneuver the long drive thru lines, make each customer feel welcomed, are attentive, and simply seem happy doing their job. Additionally, Chick-fil-A has stepped it up over the past few years by assigning order- takers along the drive thru line who'd greet you at your car to take your order.

But small accident we were involved in September of 2017 showed up on the report today. Hmm... They are giving me the run around about how it's not their fault. If you sell a car as 'Certified Used' and didn't notice a major repair on the unibody frame of the car, obviously your techs don't know what they are doing. May be the laws protect you more than it protects the buyer, but as a 'long-time dealer in the area' I expected a little more. I guess I'm an idealist that expects transparency and good business ethics. It's clear none of those things fall on your priority list.

It was recommended in a Queer Facebook group I'm in. I'm much more comfortable when I know that it's a trans-friendly environment when it comes to bodywork.\n\nThe space was kind of hard to find, so I was a few minutes late. I opened the door and met Rachel, who asked if I was a person with a different name than me. I said no and she went to get the iPad for paperwork anyway. I confirmed \"am I in the right place...?\" after I told her my name. She told me it was, handed me the iPad, and told me to take my time. I filled out the info, and while I was doing that, she was giving me the side eye... not a very friendly vibe overall. The two stars I'm giving is because on the paperwork they have Male, Female, and X. There was a box for your pronoun. That was nice to see.\n\nWe discussed my issues and the injury I wanted to work on. She asked questions and seemed to understand, and I started to feel more comfortable. I was happy I would finally get some relief. I did say I wanted to brush over everything, because I am stressed, but mostly wanted to work on my arm that I'm having trouble with.\n\nI put on the paperwork that I wanted a deep pressure massage, but that never seems to be what I actually get. She spent about 10 minutes pushing on my feet for some reason that is mysterious to me. I wanted to know why because it seemed like a waste of time. She lightly rubbed my legs, and then went to my back. She was pushing on an area and her hand would slide with my breath... and then I started trying to breathe more so her hand would actually maybe do something?? It seemed like there was no effort being put into this. Once we finally got to my injured arm, I was thinking \"Yay! Finally\". She brushed her hand down the length of my arm and left the room. And that was it. She spent a few minutes on my arm that is fine, but literally did not even touch the injured area that I went in for. Not even for one second.\n\nI didn't even feel relaxed or destressed. I felt the same. And then I was pissed, because I just spent a big chunk of my day off on a really lousy massage, and I'm still in pain.

I'm really, really, REALLY disappointed in this.\n\nWhen I left the room, she asked how I was feeling, and I was very angry\/upset.

She said we couldn't get to it because \"we spent too much time doing paperwork.\" Then maybe don't tell me to take my time? I didn't think it was excessive? I don't understand why she couldn't be more direct about how we only had time to do a full body stress relief massage OR work on the injury.

This is the first time that I have decided to come on my own with my friends. I was very excited to come here but it has turned out to be a disappointing trip. Since we arrived late, check in was quick and pretty painless. Of course after you check in they send you to another desk to get your parking pass, or aka try to rope you into a sales meeting. I am 21 and a student, therefore I have no interest in this and declined. Multiple times. The lady proceeded to tell me that normally since we are guests they would give us some kind of discount to something at the resort, but since my parents were legacy owners that I could get the same discounts that they would receive, such as park tickets. But I will come back to that later-\n\nSince we had a long trip and drove from New York, we were excited to see that we got our own villa. That turned sour after 2 nights when we found 2 roaches. We called the front desk and they said that they could send room service to pick it up. No thanks- I would like a new room please. After 2 phone calls, we were able to get a new room. Since then we haven't had any unwanted visitors (at least I hope not).\n\nFast forwarding back to the tickets- the front desk told us that with tax a 1 day park hopper to universal would be 174 each. Not much of a difference of universals price online- 175 and some change. Keep in mind, it is value season, not peak. We asked if we could come back and get that price because we figured that it would be easier to buy it at the desk then online. We went back, and the lady was not only rude, but basically overrides what the other person told me and said that the best she could do for universal was 190 without tax for the day, or 155 if we went to the meeting. Again, I am not going to the meeting since I do not have interest in buying a time share, nor do I have the money. I expressed this multiple times. She proceeded to tell me that the 190 is cheaper then online- which it is clearly not. Looking back, the first time I was at the desk the person who was helping me probably told me that price so that I would come back and they could try to rope me into the meeting again. \n\nOverall, the resort has nice pools and amenities but the customer service is lacking. Forgetting about the front desk, I would give this resort another chance but it seems like we are not the only people who felt with a pest problem.","DateTime":1512092718000,"Time_Only":"01:45:18","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"45"}

I suggest, get a potato on the side. Last entree was pork chops which my colleague loved because of the plantain that came with it.

I have been to numerous Delta Sky Clubs and this by far is the best! \n\nLocation: Being high above the terminal, you immediately enter a long, quiet hallway away from the noisy terminal. The hallway is decorated with artwork and is very modern feeling. Negative- long lines to get scanned into the club.\n\nLounge: HUGE!!! Tons of seats and plenty of outlets. Very well designed with more private-feeling areas, open lounge-style areas, and plenty of cubicles to relax and get work done. Easy access to outlets and seating is new and comfortable. Don't get me wrong, it is still crowded, but the lounge is so nice the bigger they made it the more people would come.\n\nFood: Nice touch was to have a larger food station to avoid lines along a single counter. Self-serve with standard Delta lounge food choices. The cold salads, the pasta, soups, etc. Didn't have any issues getting grub. Bar is standard drinks, decent wait time to get an order in, but staff makes the drinks quick once you get their attention. Wine bar is a nice touch, but unlike other lounges I've been, it costs even to get a taste-sized portion. You can pay with miles, which is kind of cool. In my opinion the only way this lounge could be better is by having a self-serve bar, like in DTW.\n\nStaff: Front desk\/check-in staff was somewhat cold and slow-moving, but inside the lounge everyone was very friendly and helpful. Areas are bussed quickly and frequently and only for a brief moment did they run out of snack dishes. Overall attentive staff.\n\nThis is a great Delta Skyclub and a great place to spend your layovers in ATL.","DateTime":1512092922000,"Time_Only":"01:48:42","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"1","Date_Minute":"48"}

I don't know if it was because they just opened and had special visitors, but they even had extra staff standing around greeting people, which I thought was nice, but superfluous for a Renaissance airport hotel.\n\nThe room is standard layout for most Marriott-branded hotels. Somewhat congested with a couple suitcases inside but very nice decor and modern amenities. Nice views of the skytrain and airport ;-D\n\nThe lobby is GORGEOUS. Very cool environment with the decorations and design. Plenty of space to lounge, chat, or even do some work with plenty of outlets. There is a small greenspace attached to the lobby with a small water feature and plenty of chairs and tables to hangout outside when not too hot. They also have a conference area in the back of the hotel behind the lobby.\n\nI didn't try any of the food from the restaurant but it seemed to be pretty good. Dining area doesn't have much privacy in the sense its meshed with the lobby somewhat, so depending on what type of dinner you want keep that in mind. Though you could take the Airtrain to the airport for a quick bite or even get onto MARTA to get to Midtown in 20-30 minutes if you are without car.\n\nParking is very expensive in my opinion.

Ok, that's a pretty good deal. So why am I not ranking this place higher? Well, there's a few reasons.\n\nSome of the rolls are good, but most of them aren't outstanding in any way (the Alaskan is a noteworthy exception, but covering something in sauce is a safe bet). In particular, my rainbow roll had several pieces that almost felt entirely cucumber on the inside, and my spider roll had an unpleasantly grainy texture and off-taste to it. Also, while you can stay on the cheap side, the house special rolls will make eating here an expensive proposition.\n\nOk, but that's not the be-all, end-all of a good restaurant. After all, a Sushi  restaurant that's too cheap isn't necessarily trustworthy, and Sushi isn't the kind of thing you want to skimp on the quality of. But the service in this place is frankly poor, and I'm not somebody who has a particularly high bar for what constitutes good service. I've been in at lunch when the restaurant is only half-full and waited close to an hour for food. Or, tonight, we called at 7:10 and asked for pickup. Ok, we're told it would be a half-hour wait. Fine. I get there at 7:45 and wait another twenty minutes before my food is finally ready.\n\nSo, when you're really jonesing for all-you-can-eat, this place can be do alright or even good.

Looking back to 2013, I should have thought to stay away from this place. It just looks so shady from the outside and the people inside seemed even shadier. My car had been vandalized twice when I lived in Orlando and I had enough. I took my car to Time N Sound because I wanted a Viper 2-way alarm and it was listed on Viper's website as a \"preferred dealer\" (which probably just means they buy alot of Viper products). Everything seemed ok at first. I was told that they could do everything I wanted. I don't remember quite what I paid, but it was up there (over $800 all told w Viper 5706, tilt, hood pin, trunk pin, motion & glass break). Basically, everything you could want. After maybe 4hrs they called and said I could pick up the car. When I got there the installer wasn't even finished, but I could already tell that he was rushing and looked frustrated since it was past closing time (not my fault). That's when I started getting nervous. Fast forward a few yrs and I started getting sick of how poorly the alarm worked. The motion detection was constantly going off unprovoked or NOT going off when it should. I started burning through car batteries like nobody's business. Today is the day I had enough. Since I live in Chicago, I couldn't take it back so I went to another \"preferred dealer\" here. They said they would take a look at it and get back to me after an hour or so. The installer called me back within 10 minutes and said I had to get back and look at what they found. IT WAS A FUCKING DISASTER. The wiring was basically a bunch of burnt spaghetti. Literally, burnt wiring everywhere. The installers couldn't believe it. I quote, \"I don't know how this didn't spark and cause a fire\". I had it at this point and had them remove the entire system. I wish I could go back in time and not spend over $1k to have a stock Honda alarm system. Bottom line, sometimes trust your gut instinct even it it makes you feel comfortable. I had a bad feeling about these guys and it happens I was correct. AVOID THIS SHADY BUSINESS AT ALL COSTS!!!!

His superior interrupted him from attending to me to ask him why he wasn't wearing his black slacks. The employee was wearing blue jeans. The employee told him his slacks were still in the dryer when he was getting ready for work. The manager told him this, sternly:\n\n\"Go home, get 'em, and hurry up and get your ass back here!\"\n\nVerbatim. This manager did NOT say it jokingly (or discreetly), and I'm sure it was humiliating for the employee being that he had just been made a public spectacle. I've been in management before, and I would've never spoken to an employee that way, especially not in front of customers. There's really no good excuse for this behavior.

I have absolutely no complaints about her and I definitely give her 50 stars but the admin staff is a whole other story!\n\n1. Let me start off with the patient portal.  Great idea but there isn't anything in it! I can't contact my doctor and there are absolutely no test results or doctors notes regarding my progressive treatment.  And don't set up an appointment through that system, I did it once and that was a mistake.  The system asks you to put in a few different dates that work for you and they will contact you once you are scheduled.  I put the dates in, I waited, I waited, never was contacted. I called and made an appointment, saw my doctor and then about 2 weeks later I get a letter in the mail saying that Dr. Hirsch no longer wants me as a patient because I missed my appointment that was booked through the portal. What appointment? No one ever finalized those dates and no one mentioned another appointment when I had just recently been seen.  I immediately called the woman who had signed the letter, which wasn't Dr. Hirsch by the way, and she was very snooty and said, I'm just doing what the doctor told me to do.  I totally called her out that what she was saying was bs.  I called back and asked for my doctors staff, the normal nurse who knows me because she's been with Dr. Hirsch almost as long as I have, didn't know what I was talking about.  She said she'd talk to the doctor and get back to me.  Dr. Hirsch called me later that afternoon and said she'd straightened it with the admin staff and yes I was still her patient and not to worry about that letter at all.  The next day, the snooty office person also called and said that Dr. would give me one more chance, which was a lie because my doc didn't even know they had sent me this letter terminating me as a patient - it's one thing if I was in the habit of missing appointments but it was there system that messed it up and then to tell me what they were saying was coming from my doc when the letter wasn't even signed by her was ridiculous.  Dr. Hirsch and I have a fantastic relationship and she knows all of my health history and remembers it!\n\nMy 2nd complaint, again with the admin staff, Dr requested I come in for bloodwork because of prescriptions I am on. I got there and didn't have medical insurance at the time, there policy is you have to pay up front unless it's a sensitive issue like blood work for prescriptions. I totally got the runaround, I needed to see someone in accounting because I needed to pay for my visit before I see the doctor.  I said the doctor called me and made this appointment, the response was no she didn't blah blah blah.  This, by the way, is heard by the whole waiting room who was all too aware at this point about personal medical information and my financial information. Anyway, again Dr set them straight and I was able to see her and pay when I got my next pay check.  When I got into the exam room the doctor looked at me and said, well, if you don't normally have high blood pressure I bet you do now.  Referring to the drama that had unfolded in the waiting room. \n\nAgain, I recommend Dr. Hirsch, she is fantastic but just be prepared to beat down the gatekeepers in order to see her.","DateTime":1512095575000,"Time_Only":"02:32:55","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"2","Date_Minute":"32"}

From the moment you walk trough the doors to valet your car you are treated like royalty.

We had our massages and at the end were taken to a sleep lounge\/relaxation lounge. We were given a delicious truffle and glass of champagne. (Everyone gets it after each treatment!!) score!  After a Little we each went back to our assigned areas, and took advantage of the eucalyptus steam room (I am still dreaming about this) the all senses shower. It has a panel that you get to select what setting you want, my favorite was the thunder storm. The lights and music along with the water and how they have it synchronized is bananas!!  They have the ice fountain for when you get done at the sauna (pretty crazy and cool) and the jacuzzi area.  We spent a good 7 hours there and only had a one hour massage.  \n\nMy husband had such a good time that he announced we need to come back every 6 months and treat ourselves.

The lamb was perfectly cooked as requested and it was delicious. It wasn't gamy at all which is always one of my hesitations when ordering lamb. The Filet was also cooked perfectly as requested.\n\nI am deducting 1 star because of the service. Before ordering the entrees, I asked our waitress in regards to the portions of the entrees. I personally HATE wasting food when traveling and you all know too well that when traveling, you can't eat the left-overs..... Having said that, I asked the waitress how big the portion sizes were. I wish, she had told us about the \"Steak El Gaucho\", that would have been perfect for 2 people in addition to ordering some sides. Half of the rack of lamb that I had ordered was left untouched which was painful to watch.\n\nUnfortunately, in the past, I have tried to give food to the homeless people, but I have encountered some unexpected reactions as they don't want food, just money. \n\nHaving said that, this can be a good coaching opportunity for the waiter staff by the management.","DateTime":1512096483000,"Time_Only":"02:48:03","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"2","Date_Minute":"48"}

On the 3 piece dark, I think the drumstick was the best of the bunch as it was the crispest and juiciest. The thigh is meaty but bit too much moisture in the crust that makes it a bit soggy. The wing has some breast meat attached to it but also a weird section of the bird that did not seem to taste very good. I thought it was a large chunk of breading - it definitely was not.\n\nThe fries are actually really good too and the bread although bland is a good palate cleanser to soak up grease.\n\nAlso, they got a to go line and the in house line.

I really like the fashion forward options and the unexpected surprises, (quality items at great prices).  You really have to know how and where to shop in the store to get the greatest benefit.  For example, I would not purchase accessories like shoes or bags simply because these are the items most likely to be of a lesser quality.  If you are going to purchase clothing, simply check fabric composition and construction to make sure that your are purchasing a well made item.  \n\nI like their home decor and kitchen accessories.  They have a small section of kitchen cleaning supplies, which is perfect for getting exactly what I need.\n\nThis newer store appeared to be very well stocked with clothing and household items which is surprising considering I had recently visited  two other locations that were screaming \"We barely survived Black Friday!\".  Unlike some of the older stores, this one had a complete jewelry department so you can find sterling silver options available.  I happened upon this location by accident but needed to return an item. \n\nHere is what you need to know:  If you purchase sterling silver or 14kt. gold at one of their locations, you may have to return it to the same location because not all locations will accept a return.  I purchased some earrings in Cumming and wanted to return them at my store in Johns Creek but since that store is no longer selling jewelry, (just watches), I could not return my earrings there.  Luckily, I was able to return them at this location with no problem.  Remember, Ross is open late for last minute shoppers and this location has a security officer available.  \n\nTo make the most of your time at Ross, avoid shopping on your lunch break when the lines are long and the employees are few.  If you can shop at the opening hour or after 9pm, you will have a much better shopping experience.

Really deserving of two and a half stars at times, three possibly at others. Acre is expensive, for two kids meals and our small meals (no fountain drinks, no desserts) plus a tip at the counter it was over 40$. I don't mind paying more for local and healthy food if it's good food. The problem is that it is rarely good. The black bean hummus was so boring and the mammoth sized carrot sticks that were stuck right into the hummus, were slimy wet and got water all over the food. The kimchi tacos were a soggy mess and everything in it looked exactly the same, my spicy chicken salad sandwich wasn't spicy and for 10$ it was just terribly boring. My sons kids meal bowl, was decent in value and size and ingredients, my daughters chicken skewer was okay and the cheapest item but definitely not worth a penny more than we payed. The chicken was super fatty and chewy. We have been a few times and my score is based on all our visits.

The drink is $10, so it's quite pricey, but refreshing. The carrot cake flavor was definitely there. Delicious velvety almond milk, carrot, banana, coconut oil, cashew, spice blend, and maca (whatever that is). I might have chugged that drink too fast, but thankfully had no brain-freeze. \n\nAlthough I wouldn't go to Skyebird on a regular basis (since I'll go broke), I would go here to treat myself to a healthy delicious smoothie once in a while. \n\nSkyebird is located inside East End Market. It is set like a bar with the hipster mason jar madness. Mason jar light fixtures and cups. Some recipe books are available to read on the counter. The clear jars of spices and herbs displayed are great, so you can see the wide variety they have in their kitchen. There were two cooks\/smoothie baristas making the food, which was cool to see. Watching your food be made is sometimes fun, unless you're seeing butchering or de-gutting. Not in this case, since Skyebird seems to be a vegan place. I'm not vegan, but love seeing the wide variety of creative drinks\/dishes on the menu. \n\nThe cashier\/server was friendly when I ordered. There were 2 women in front of me taking forever to look over the menu, and they didn't even order anything. The cashier\/server was nice to them and said, \"Feel free to come back if you find something you like.\" \n\nHe seemed busy, since he was the only one in front. I suppose they are short-staffed, but it would be nice to quickly ask the customers if they like their food\/drink or simply say \"Enjoy!\" when serving the drink. He just placed the drink and gave me a straw without saying anything. I understand he might have felt rushed though, so I still overall enjoyed Skyebird's chill atmosphere vibe.","DateTime":1512097318000,"Time_Only":"03:01:58","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"3","Date_Minute":"1"}

I've dined solo and with a group of three and four. And my favorite visits are with a group so you can order a bunch of dishes and eat family style sampling a little bit of everything.\n\nMy favorite item on the current menu is the Korean Cauliflower from the small plates menu. Seriously addictive.\n\nOther items I've had several times and continue to enjoy are the Thai Chimichurri Steak, the Jungle Prince (green curry), and Korean Street Noodles.\n\nNow the disclaimers. The food is Asian fusion and modern. The cocktail list is odd and engaging and some drinks pack a serious kick. Both menus are small and filled with bold flavors, pungent aromas, and some oddball combos. I haven't loved everything I've had here. But, every meal has been successful. And I've never had an issue with service.\n\nI like the casual, masculine, industrial vibe of the restaurant. There are TVs at the bar and so there is usually a group watching a game in the evenings. So, not a quiet, romantic vibe, but I've found it ideal for an adventurous group who want to eat, drink, and be merry. For an outing with my kids with more pedestrian tastes, it isn't as successful.\n\nThis is one of those places that are great to try for Happy Hour so you can order a bunch of things and sample away.","DateTime":1512098277000,"Time_Only":"03:17:57","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"3","Date_Minute":"17"}

It's just something about the variety of color and types of desserts all lined up perfectly along the edge of the display case. Polished and picture-perfect!\n\nDespite the lines, service is fairly quick, but allows you just enough time to decide on your order. We probably should have asked for recommendations, but we just based our picks solely off of appearance.\nI got the Chocolate Raspberry Tart, which had a decadent chocolate ganache and raspberry jam atop a graham cracker crust. The ganache was creamy and rich, but the crust seemed to be the miss here... I thought it would have a buttery flavor, but instead, it was pretty bland. We also got a Cinnamon Record, which is a huge round flaky pastry covered in a cinnamon glaze. It is actually the size of a music record, so it's perfect for sharing! Unfortunately it was on the dry side and didn't live up to our expectations. \n\nMy family tried the Key Lime Tart which seemed to be a winner...had the right amount of sweetness and embodied exactly what a key lime pie should be. \nOverall, I'd definitely be willing to give Stuart's another chance.

Were you expecting it to not be busy? If so, drink some strong coffee and WAKE UP! \n\n3.) Always order dessert. Most hotel restaurants hire talented pastry chefs.

I've been here twice- once for brunch and once for dessert. The brunch was a prefix\/a la carte menu. For some foolish reason, I announced to my friends I wasn't too hungry and that I was going to order two starters instead of one main meal. Of course it wasn't until after the beautiful assortment of homemade bread was put in front of me with a side of delectably soft butter that I realized I was hungry. I devoured three slices of cranberry nut bread and both of my starters. \n\nThe food was yummy, but I wish I had explored the menu a bit more. I ordered trout crostinis and oysters. The trout was extremely fresh and decorated with fresh radish and greens. All my friends were happy with their meals as well. \n\nThe restaurant decor is very farmers chic. You instantly feel like you are in your own home or vacationing in Maine. Our servers were very attentive and helpful. \n\nWe will definitely be back!

I was convinced that I sorely needed an entirely different type of bra that would be a custom fit just for me. I was told that they would rush the new bras to me and they should arrive by 10-14 days (silly me, I bought four). It took over three weeks and prodding to receive them. During that interaction I was told, \"After all you've waited this long before your fitting...what's the big deal?\" Finally the four identical bras arrived and tried the one on. It was very uncomfortable and dug into me. Also, it's the first lined bra I've ever had that shows my nipples through various clothes. (When trying this on I expressed concern about this but was told that it wouldn't be a problem. Well it was!) When I sent a photo by email about the deep mark the wire was creating I was told to give it three weeks and it would mold correctly to my body. That would mean that I would need to wear all four bras three months before I would possibly be comfortable. One option given to me was to come back into the shop for a refitting. Well, I live several states away, so that wouldn't work! I returned all four and requested a full refund. (They refuse.) I don't see why I should pay for the one I briefly wore for half a day, since this was supposed to be a custom fit and after all, they require three weeks to see if it would work...crazy logic! These are very expensive bras at $120 each!! If they were such a special store and if they have expertise in fittings, why has this been so difficult?

There are so many different books about such a diverse range of subjects that you find books that you didn't even know you would have needed. There's different sections labeled by color to help you get started if you have an idea for what genre of book you want to read. They have different gifts that you can get for family or friends back home that range from bandannas to water bottles to games to stickers to so much more. I got a couple of books for myself and some of their awesome reusable bags as well as gifts for people back home. So if you're making up your mind on what to do in Portland when you visit, please make this one of your stops.

Once done, and I would have ordered another drink but no opportunity and no refill on my water, we requested a check from the waitress.  Waited a long long time and I went to the bartender and told him we'd been waiting a while for the requested check and the check was produced in about 20 seconds.  We then gave the check to the waitress and waited again, ect ect ect.  You get the picture.

Although, I don't recommend parking on the lower gated level as that gate is often left open and has resulted in alleged theft from other residents. And despite there being a gated access garage, there have been a couple of car break-ins since I've lived here. \n\nThere's a dog run\/Park, but it doesn't smell great and a lot of the residents just let their dogs go out there to bark at other dogs. \n\nWhile I've never heard my next door neighbors, I've experienced continuous and daily disruption from not one, but two upstairs tenants.

I understand if the hostess cannot take orders but surely setting a table is reasonable. Instead of seating people who want to sit at the bar first she instead wants to go in order of wait time so she had to seat people who wanted a table first (and not the bar) while the bar sits empty. Only when a table is available and she sits the table group then she allows people to sit at the bar. Wow. If this was a fine dining establishment I may understand the need for restricted roles. They need to take some tips from din dai fung. Such good food, but obviously they don't read their reviews because their inability to change their seating service is incredibly disappointing.

It was going to be my girlfriend her daughter and myself. We decided on Ruths Chris Because of their reputation and location. Week prior to Thanksgiving I called the restaurant to find out about a reservation and what menu options were available . My girlfriend's daughter is a vegetarian and I want to make sure there would be ample vegetarian options available to her. The girl who answered sounded like she was not intrested and It did not know what she was talking about she told me that there was no vegetarian options available and the only thing on the menu for Thanksgiving was a special Thanksgiving menu of turkey and Fixin's. This didn't sound right to me so I called the Waltham location. Staff at that location will much more helpful and Professional they informed me that there was the full menu with several vegetarian options and the Thanksgiving Day specials . So I called back to school street location and explained my experience to the manager he seemed about as interesting as the 1st girl I spoke with at that location.  But in trusting in the Ruth's Chris name  we made the reservation anyway. We Ordered  2 appetizers . Mushroom caps and ravioli . They were both lukewarm and the mushroom Tasted very fishy. For entrees and sides We ordered a cowboy ribeye a regular ribeye With lobster Mac and cheese , Creamed spinach and her daughter got a salad and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese Had no flavor and the lobster What's this weird shade of paint that also had no flavor we sent the whole plate back un touched  The stakes were good and cooked right but my steak must have been done before hers because it was cool the only thing that even remotely salvaged it was the sizzling hot plate . I table was loaded with crumbs and dirty the entire time the waiter never came over to see how our steaks were cooked right and done to our liking . I asked him for a couple suggestions on a wine and a port wine . You seem to have no knowledge of the Of the wines and simply seemed to suggest the most expensive ones on the menu 3 glasses $65. The manager never came to a table even know we sent a plate back. At $365 with tip I've had better service and meals at Texas Roadhouse . It is my firm belief that a restaurant runs from the management down .

I pay atleast $80.00 for Shaw Cable (not including their internet\/phone service which is also horrible, but not going to get into that). The channels that I pay for are frequently doing something called 'pixalization'? It looks like static waves throughout the program before it blacks out for hours at a time, only to come back to the static, followed by normal television some days, back to that pixilation after. This is horrible for my Grandmother who can barely use electronics and constantly having to reset the box to watch T.V that I pay a lot for makes zero sense. \n\nI called Shaw about this on November. 30. 2017 because it literally said on the television to call Shaw and speak to customer support. Sure no problem. Right now I'm 1:08:00 Hours, so an hour and 10 minutes on hold. Still waiting from that initial computerized 1800 thing every company has.. 'click 1\/2\/1\/1\/1' whatever, and have yet to speak to an actual person. \n\nI did what any other person does, I went online to check if I could speak to a  representative online. Shaw has a convenient 'Chat' button which is a 20 minute wait to talk to a representative. So I wait, and wait, and am currently still waiting along with that phone call to speak to a Shaw rep. The chat goes from 5:00 minute wait, back to 10:00 minute wait, back to 5:00, than to 12:00 minute wait. Obviously it's not gonna work and this phone call is a huge waste of time. \n\nTake my advice, SAVE YOUR MONEY. STAY AWAY FROM SHAW. Horrible customer service, unless you don't mind spending your night on hold waiting to talk to a  representative to ask why your already horrible television connection has somehow gotten worse.\n\nEDIT: I didn't even get through to talk to a Shaw rep. after waiting almost an hour and a half I left it and the T.V\/Shaw was working fine. Great? Nope. It lasted 3 hours before my connection went back to being laggy, slow, and pixalization? until you can barely watch basic channels such as Sports, News, or any of the premium channels you pay for.

I had only 1,5 hours and she said it was no problem to do Gel mani-pedi four hands. Pedicurist was a friendly young man except for being a specialist. Kim (I guess, her name was Kim, she is an administrator) did my hand nails in the beginning and the man finished them with the polishing. I looked carefully at my nails when paying for the service USD 75 + tips (NB: way above the market price) and did not like several nails which had strange fingerprints. I mentioned this to the receptionist and she offered to fix them, my schedule permitting. I thanked her and left the salon. When I looked at my nails in the evening I was shocked. The polish literally started to decay. Several fingers were left without polish! And we are talking about gel manicure that is supposed to stay for more than 2 week. The pedicure was also far from being perfect. It had a lot of white spots around edges. I came back to the salon the next day and asked for the reimbursement. Administrator was rude, telling me that it was my problem that I was in rush and that they do not reimburse for the service provided. The only thing they could do was fixing the problem. In my case it meant doing the manicure from scratch again. I told her that did not want to do mani-pedi at this place again, plus I did not have time this week anyway.

This hefty sandwich was piled high with pastrami, monterey jack cheese, onions, bacon, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, and hot cherry peppers. The pastrami was the star of the show, but the other ingredients elevated the flavor profile of the sandwich. The hot cherry peppers contributed some heat and helped to cut out the saltiness from the meat while the bacon added a welcome crunch. \n\n3.

The menu and photos looked like the food would be authentic and quite divine. The restaurant looked trendy and high-end. To my avail, the food was disappointing; authenticity was absolutely not there and it was very pricey. Perhaps I had misinterpret or misread that this would be an authentic Chinese cookery and had the wrong expectations. Such expectations that would spoil my first impression. \n\nWe had roasted cauliflower that I happen to know that the sauce wasn't that creative. I seems like the Thai Chili Sweet and Sour Sauce that comes out of the bottle. We also had Hot and Sour Soup that was incredibly salty and room temperature (Definitely do NOT recommend the Hot and Sour Soup). The Scallion Pancake with the Sweet Chili Chutney was the BEST. Crispy and flaky pancake and sweet and crunchy sweet chili sauce. For entree we shared a nice fresh Vegetarian Dan Dan Noodle Dish that was small in portion but very flavorful and pleasant with a hardy runny egg sauce. The Dan Dan Noodles definitely saved the restaurant from a harsh opinion. It had freshly pulled noodles that were soft yet springy.\n\nI simply wish that an authentic Asian restaurant would finally get featured in an upscale restaurant in Austin. It would be refreshing to be able to tour friends and family to a nice place that has good Chinese food for once. I think that kind of place still has to be in North Austin's Chinatown.","DateTime":1512103334000,"Time_Only":"04:42:14","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"4","Date_Minute":"42"}

Had two of each, with the exception of the Shooting Point Salt (we got 4 of those). In hindsight, I'm glad we got 4 of the Shooting Point Salt oysters, because the other 5 varieties really didn't merit any mention by name. I don't know whether it's because too much ice melted atop these oysters or what, but flavor was hard to come by when eating the other 5 varieties. The Shooting Point oysters however were definitely good. It was like night and day compared to the other 5. \n\nAs for the plates, we had the following:\n\nBang Bang lobster roll- This was a relatively small H&F roll stuffed with a decent amount of lobster drizzled with a sriracha mayo-type sauce. It was surprisingly good, and left a lingering burn on my lips that was actually pleasant. \n\nSeafood stew- Braised tilapia in a tomato-based sauce (with a kick!) with octopus, clams, shrimp, and chickpeas. A solid seafood stew- the chickpeas served as a filler, but complemented the rest of the elements well. \n\nManila clams- Swimming in a tart yet creamy broth, this clam dish was definitely interesting on the palate in a good way. \n\nIf oysters are the main draw of this place (as per their name), they should pay a bit more attention to their oysters. Otherwise the rest of their food is actually pretty good.","DateTime":1512103349000,"Time_Only":"04:42:29","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"4","Date_Minute":"42"}

All six of us ordered steaks thinking it was a smart move at a nice steakhouse... That is typically what people order at a steakhouse, right?  We could not have been more disappointed.  Steaks range a la carte from $42-65 without sides.  The server asked us to cut into our steaks when presented, and four out of six of them were over insanely overcooked.  I let the server know mine was over, but was trying not to be \"that person\" who has to wait for another steak while the rest of my family acted like theirs was ok.  I gladly accepted the new steak once the manager offered it taking 5 minutes to fire another one. My new steak was blue (I ordered medium rare to begin with), but I wasn't about to send back a steak twice, as I was already set back in timing with the first.   My brother in law ordered a steak medium rare and it was well done. Not an ounce of red or pink even.  My mother is law ordered medium and it was well done, completely brown.  I ended up giving her my original medium steak that I originally ordered medium rare, as it was a better fit than hers.  Thank God for the side dishes which filled me up as I just ate the seared edges to my steak. The manager came out and he did realize they were all over cooked after being shown (my family isn't the type to complain) and apologized. This obviously was not his fault and he did realize the situation which was appreciated.\n\nThey did offer complimentary dessert and comped the wine which was very kind. Desserts were classic and delicious. Thank you for the dessert, much appreciated and I'm glad they made an attempt to try to save the dinner.  However, for these prices, the service was unfortunately not on point.  We sat cocktail-less and without wine after 15-20 min after ordering.  I poured my own wine from the bottle all night.  I have eaten at many fine dining restaurants and this was not up to par. I am\nalso in the restaurant business myself, so I feel saddened by writing this review as I know it can be taken very personally...   \n \nTiming on cooking steaks is everything. I hope Sullivan's can get their act together, as this is a beautiful restaurant in a great location.   I wasn't surprised that the restaurant was only about 10% full considering the quality of food and service.  I'm sorry, I typically write really good reviews for restaurants :(  I hope the managers take this review without judgement and improve the quality of the restaurant (may have been a one off night?)\n\nStill a memorable night, but unfortunately not for the reasons you would expect in terms of dining.  :(","DateTime":1512103407000,"Time_Only":"04:43:27","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"4","Date_Minute":"43"}

They told my daughter she had a lot of childcare experience and was highly qualified. My daughter and her husband skyped and called the Au Pair about five times and she seemed bubbly and sweet when they spoke to her each time. She said she had experience as a summer childcare helper at camps.  She sounded wonderful in every way. The Au Pair was 19 years old which we thought would mean she would be energetic and a great playmate for my granddaughters. My daughter paid $6,000 -$8,000 up front (I can't recall the exact amount now) and got a room in her home all ready for her, and her family was so excited. It was a lot of work reorganizing their house to have it all perfect for her arrival, but they were happy to do it. She arrived and they quickly found out she didn't really enjoy playing with kids and seemed to have no experience with children whatsoever, as the Au Pair Co. had promised she did have. My daughter gave her the baby to take care of, since she was so bad with the 4 yr old. That didn't work out either, as she fell asleep holding the newborn twice in a period of two days, while acting completely bored. Her work hours were 4-8pm and she stayed up all night watching movies, woke up at noon and stumbled upstairs to mess up the kitchen and leave a bunch of dishes in the sink, when she didn't demand the daytime nanny make her a home cooked breakfast, then managed to start work at 4pm in her pajamas. During that time, she demanded an Uber transportation budget of $200\/month, besides a bike, and requested $400 worth of her own additional groceries per week, besides having access to all the food in the family's refrigerator, and there is always tons there, and the home cooked dinners from the family each night (which they were happy to give her...but soon they realized they just were her full time caregivers, getting nothing in return). She said she liked to eat filet mignon, and they even got her 3 every week, that she just let spoil in the refrigerator, because she didn't want to ever cook. So this you could say, was just getting unlucky with the wrong au pair- a kid who really didn't want to work and was thinking it was a way to get away from home and vacation in the US. (Makes you wonder how it is sold to the girls they hire at this company.) When they told the agency what was going on, they said they needed to go through an additional two week probation period, then they needed to house her for another two weeks after that, while they tried to re-position her. My daughter and son-in-law asked the company how they could feel right passing her onto to someone else, after their experience, and it was clear they could not care less- it was all about getting the initial thousands from their clients. You can only imagine how fun it is to have someone live with you, who knows they have not worked out in the job you hired them for, and you have to keep them on for weeks.  And on top of this, because they are nice, they kept paying her for doing nothing for several weeks (you try to keep the situation as happy as possible with someone living under your roof in this circumstance)! My daughter is so sorry she didn't just find someone locally after all this and has now spoken to a bunch of people who had the same experience with this company. Since then, she hired a local woman and is happier than ever, but living through this nightmare only made her realize the downside of having an au pair live in your home.","DateTime":1512103641000,"Time_Only":"04:47:21","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"4","Date_Minute":"47"}

A couple of my friends wandered around the neighborhood and stumbled across this place. While we were looking at the menu, a random person came out of the front door and said,\" Wow! The food was amazing. Very satisfying.\" We thought this was just a satisfied customer and asked him what was good here. He mentioned the carbonara, shrimp and scallops a la vodka, and the seafood risotto.\n\nI ended up getting the Al dente special, which has a pretty overwhelming amount of ingredients. It has so many types of meat and vegetables, but somehow the white wine garlic butter sauce pulls it all together. The portions of the main dishes are really big, so I would recommend sharing and maybe getting an appetizer. My friends got the shrimp and scallop pasta with vodka sauce and the seafood risotto. They looked pretty good. The seafood risotto had so much mussels and clams that my friend got full before he made it to the risotto, which is buried on the bottom.\n\nThe service was really good since it wasn't too busy. It turns out the \"satisfied\" customer we saw in the beginning was actually working there. Pretty funny. They accept credit here, but don't expect to split the check like 10 ways.

I am a pretty big fan of Indian food in general, but there is something different and more wonderful about this restaurant than any of the other Indian restaurants I've tried in the area. Perhaps it is partly due to the fact that they serve both South and North Indian cuisine, but they're also just a little magical. \n\nMy boyfriend and I tend to eat here maybe once a month or so (it's usually not at a time when their lunch buffet is available). Even their regular menu leaves me smiling and with a happy tummy, though. I appreciate the smiles, kindness, the lovely cadence of their voices, and the promptness of the folks who work at Abhiruchi.\n\nDuring dinner they always start you out with a plate of crispy, crunchy Paratha - a type of lentil wafer, and a trio of chutneys\/sauces - one is tomato-based and sort of spicy, one is coconut-based and also a little spicy, and the other is mint-based and not quite as spicy as the other two.\n \nItems we tend to order often: \nUttapam - a large (dinner plate sized), thick pancake consisting of lentil and rice flour and large chunks of onions and chilies, served with a cup of Sambar Soup for dipping.\nMixed Vegetable Pakora - small bites of various vegetables coated in chickpea batter and fried. \nAloo Gobi - cauliflower, potatoes and tomatoes cooked in a spicy sauce and served with rice.\nBendi Masala - okra with spices. This dish isn't very \"saucy\" and it's almost like the okra is in a dry rub of some kind. This is what my boyfriend usually orders and it gets pretty dang spicy. I can usually only steal a few bites of it because my mouth gets too upset, but the flavor is phenomenal. \n\nIf entrees are ordered a la carte they are served with naan.\nIf you order any of the entrees as a \"Thali dinner\" you also are served small bowls of a dal curry, a vegetable curry of the day, sambar soup and raita, and the choice of a dessert when you are finished. This seems to be somewhat standard at Indian restaurants - at least those I've been to.\n\nIf you do happen to go on a day when the lunch buffet is available, oh boy oh boy oh boy! There are so many unique vegetarian dishes that they serve. If I'm recalling correctly there are usually at least 5 meat dishes out, and 7 or 8 vegetarian dishes, not to mention the naan, pakoras, sauces, and desserts. I really appreciate the selection and the flavors. I'm not sure if they have vegan options or not, but most of their South Indian Specialties seem to be at least egg-free. We tend toward the vegetarian options and they have those a-plenty. \n\nThe food is always delicious, and flavors are big. \nThe staff are kind and prompt.\nThe prices are reasonable.\nI love this place.","DateTime":1512104146000,"Time_Only":"04:55:46","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"4","Date_Minute":"55"}

I came in and Tony (who turned out, somehow, to be the owner) advised that I order two front tires to match the back two (the fronts were a tad smaller \/ different than the back). I followed that advice and also requested an alignment check. When they called me for pick up, they said they hadn't done the alignment and even claimed I didn't ask for it; they begrudgingly said they could put it back on the lift. Upon picking up, I was told they hadn't done the alignment after all. \n\nEven worse, after taking my truck to Gene Johnson Automotive (an amazing, kind shop) for a check up, I was told the front tires are too big for my truck's front end and are rubbing and potentially damaging. I'm very disappointed that a tire professional would sell me expensive new tires per his own advice without checking to make sure they fit; after reading great reviews of the place, I trusted them. \n\nAnyhow, I emailed to get this resolved quickly. Unfortunately, I saw the kind of unprofessional response to my concerned email coming from a mile away, and I was right, receiving a cold, accusatory, and non-apologetic response from Tony (the owner) a couple days later. As I told them in my email, from the moment I walked into the shop (out of necessity, mind you, since my tire popped in the neighborhood), I was, for reasons unknown to me, met with impatience, disinterest, and a very unprofessional lack of collaboration\/cooperation\/communication.\n\nI emailed a couple times and I have called multiple times already without once having my name and number taken or call returned; all I have received is a single email, containing only accusations that my memory is wrong and an insistence that it was my fault the tires were wrong, with zero apology or offer to help right this wrong. The most concerning thing, regardless of details, is that they sold a customer that was trusting their professional opinion over two hundred dollars worth of tires that they later admitted knew wouldn't fit my truck. As my regular mechanic said, any professional shop should've advised me against it, and a quality inspection \/ test drive should've caught the mistake regardless. I mean I even doubted it, which is why I asked, \"Wll it work to match all four?\" in the beginning. But I naively trusted Tony, the professional.\n\nClearly, I am thoroughly disappointed in the service I received, the product I was given, and especially in the customer service later. I will be taking my business elsewhere and encouraging all y'all, my friends, family, and the schools\/businesses I work with to do the same. I grew up in a small town where our mechanic, as Tony should be, was someone who would be honest, collaborative, and kind, and he is none of those things.","DateTime":1512104513000,"Time_Only":"05:01:53","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"5","Date_Minute":"1"}

We explained we could put down a decent down payment but couldn't yet prove our employment because we had only lived in Portland for 2 weeks and didn't have pay stubs or any way to prove our income. They assured us this wouldn't be an issue since we were putting down $3500. \nThe next day, we got a call and were told to come back in because the bank didn't approve the loan for our car. This was terrifying. How could we drive the car off the lot if the bank didn't approve it? Especially after all the paperwork we signed, agreeing to the monthly payment and rate they offered us. \nWe went back to get it sorted out, and instead of the $250\/month we originally agreed to., they told us the best they could do was $325\/month because we couldn't prove our employment. \nA couple issues-\nThey should have been honest from the start.

After searching Yelp and reading the reviews, I was excited for one of my favorites, Indian food. I couldn't wait to eat since first, we were hungry but also the place was busy and people kept ordering take-away as well. I figured this place must be great. There wasn't any rhyme or reason to the seating that we could see. Other people were seated before us until an older women working there explained they were preparing our table. Once seating it took some time but we finally were able to order. The waiter asked us about the spice level for the dishes we ordered, which was 1-6, I was sharing with two of my younger kids so at the waiter's recommendation I got a level 2 spice. My husband LOVES spice and usual gets his Indian food HOT! The waiter suggested 3 and said 4-6 was \"too spicy.\" Um, okay...why offer it then as an option? My husband said he's like a 4-5 then. The waiter say \"Okay 3\" and walked away. My husband and I stared at each other like did that just happen? Whatever, especially since we were hungry by then. Food came and so much disappointment happened after that. My husband ordered Curry Chicken according to him there was no spice and boring. I'm sorry Indian food should NEVER be boring. Ever! I had to agree with the Lamb Saag I ordered. It could have used more spices, saag, and just just not exciting at all. I ordered the paratha and it was chewy, not flaky, I didn't finish after a bite or two. My teenage son ordered his favorite Chicken Makhani, and he usually eats it all. No chicken left on his plate. With this dish he had over half left so I knew he didn't care for it much. I tasted it and just flavorless like the other dishes. My hubby and son said the naan was okay and we enjoyed the Mango Juice (which is usually hard to mess up). Again back to the waiter, half way through we asked for more rice and instead of taking the used rice bowl away he dumped the fresh rice into the used bowl. \nI'm not sure what all the great reviews are about, and not to insult anyone, but maybe the locals have never had real authentic Indian food.

We are both ramen snobs so this place definitely hit the bar and expectations high.\n\nIt's on the east side of the river a few blocks up from the river bank. We walked over from downtown Portland and if you don't enjoy walking a lot, I would recommend just driving over and finding street parking. The inside of the restaurant was very Portland hipster and I loved it. The menu is clean and organized making it very easy to look at and decide. I ordered the Yuzu Shio and my friend got the tsukemen. We both shared the tofu and gyoza. The tofu and gyoza came first and both were amazing! We both agreed we could have eaten another order of the gyoza. The ramen I had was different. The yuzu made it more citrus than I'm used to and much lighter than heavier meat broths, but I would definitely order it again. The flavor grew on me and I enjoyed the way I felt after all that food. Due to the broth being so light, it left me feeling full but not overly stuffed. Would highly recommend coming here in a small group to beat waits and crowds.

We felt rushed and kind of judged even though we weren't the ones asking the workers for help with taking photos. Don't get me wrong some of the other workers were a delight but one bad apple can ruin a bunch. \n\nDuring the middle of our experience one of the workers asked if they could take a photo of us and we said yes. Later on we found out that our picture was printed and turned into a sticker. They had a wall that had an outline of the word ICE CREAM and they were filling it up with the pictures they were taking of the groups there. One of the workers told us they can make another copy so that we may keep while the other can be posted on their wall.

Unfortunately, with only 3 people at 630pm on a Thursday night, the service was worse... how?\n\nOur server, Ally, came right away. We asked for 2 waters and an iced tea. It took 10 minutes for drinks to be brought to the table. Then she disappeared - not a word about if we were interested in ordered any appetizers. Another 10 plus minutes and she still was not back. We finally flagged another server asking to find Ally. She came by to tell us she would be back. \n\nShe did come and take our order finally - they do not write anything down here - and left again. A few minutes later she came to clarify something. Shortly our app came (fried okra) and it was pretty good. Batter stayed on the okra, great, spicy dipping sauce, and a good portion for sharing. I think I'd have preferred them to be cut in half. It would have helped with the slime factor. Overall, a solid app.\n\nOur entrees came and a mistake or two happened. 1) Ally cleared some utensils with our app plates - so one of us had nothing to eat with. Since She never came around, we shared. 2) My seatmate ordered no onions in her dish. That was missed. We flagged our server and she took the dish to be remade. Lots of explanations later, and the other two of us had finished and still, no replacement dish. Also, we had to go because we had Symphony tickets. \n\nAt this point, we cancelled the missing dish and asked for checks. A bit of hemming and hawing and we finally got our checks and got to pay (no charge for the onion laden wrap). \n\nFood was good - my rigatoni alla vodka with chicken was delicious. Service atrocious (server cared nothing for our table and I had to stop her running past our table each time). Also, crazy loud inside. All wood - nothing to really absorb sound. \n\nI may try again, but not with the same server. She clearly had too many tables to manage. I don't need someone to my table constantly, but seeing her 4 times in 90 minutes isn't great.","DateTime":1512107613000,"Time_Only":"05:53:33","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"5","Date_Minute":"53"}

My first trial of the many tribulations was parking! The location is right off of Peachtree on Juniper Street where there is little to no parking for this establishment. There was a sign located in front of the building that said \"complimentary valet at Wells Fargo across the street\". I went over to Wells Fargo and there was no signs, no directions, no information for this valet parking that was mentioned. I was able to find street parking ultimately. Keeping in mind that the Lawrence is on a one-way street, so every time I passed the establishment, I would have to circle the block and try again for parking. I also want to make note that there is a parking garage attached to the establishment but no restaurant parking is allowed. \n\nSo, once I finally arrived in the restaurant, I sat down at a booth near the window and per the previous reviews I had read, There were bottomless mimosas for brunch offered here. I asked for this special and was informed that they no longer do the bottomless mimosas. This was disappointing but I still went ahead and ordered a mimosa. It was good. I was also asked if I wanted water when I sat down, as I replied with a yes. When the water came out to the table it was a bottle of Fiji Water which I asked how much it was and was told $6! I told them I no longer wanted the water. \nI go ahead and order my lunch, the menu consists of a variety of Seafood Pork and Beef options. I went with the hamburger and was pleased with the aroma when it arrived! the sandwich came with french fries and it was on a nice bun with two patties onions pickles and cheese. The food smelled  absolutely delicious when it arrived! I was excited to try it and when I took my first bite of not only the sandwich but the fries as well, I was struck with only mediocre flavors. I continue eating the sandwich hoping to reach the center where the pleasant aroma must have been originating from. I'm sure you can guess by the stars given that I never reached that great bite that I was waiting for. Overall, in terms of the atmosphere The Establishment appears to be a little small and quaint maybe not the best for groups but a nice bar atmosphere for Friday or Saturday night. The service was alright the food was poor the parking was dismal.

Our visit was right after the clips of the elephants and other animals frolicking in the snow made it around the county on the news and the internet. \n\nWhen we got to the zoo, it was immediately crazy. The parking lot was iced over and cars were driving super slow and some were sliding on ice as they drove. You self pay for parking at kiosks in the lot, by entering your parking spot number and buying time. But since the lot was covered in snow and ice, you couldnt pay properly.\n\nWhen we got inside the zoo, most of it was closed off and animals were off exhibit.  The hardier animals were out, but they did not seem as exited for the snow as they did on TV. It was still pretty cool seeing some of them out in the snow, particularly the seals in their huge tank. They were probably the most active of all the animals there. The polar bear was surprisingly not having it in the snow.\n\nThe animal habitats were nice and looked pretty in the snow. Many of them had climate controlled habitats, which was cool for everyone. The elephants had a giant indoor area (and a huge outdoor space too).  The primate section indoors too, which meant their spaces were a little small, but they seemed to be in good spirits. The downside to indoor habitats, other than space, is that they are a little stinky.\n\nWe had a great time exploring the zoo in the snow, even though most was closed off.

While attempting to move one of the countertops containing a cut out for a sink, the Chinese gentleman lifted it incorrectly and cracked the granite.  He looked absolutely dejected as if he was going to sob.  Sinel then pulled me aside and pleaded for me not to tell Alice because she would send him back to China. Sinel told me that Alice brings Chinese immigrants to the US to perform the installations, barely pays them anything, and constantly threatens to send them back to China if they make her upset.  I was then told to drive to their warehouse in my Ford Expedition to pick-up another granite slab and when I got there, Alice refused to load it until I paid for the piece even though her employee broke it.  After paying for the slab, she fold me I had to climb on top of the stacks of granite risking life and limb and connect the clamps attached to the fork lift so she could lift it.  She then slammed the piece of granite into the back of my Expedition leaving a huge dent and laughed about it.  I was absolutely astonished by this woman and wondered how she was still in business.  When I finally got the piece back home and the hole for the sink was cut, the Chinese gentleman once again cracked the slab in the same place.  Sinel then assured me the crack wasn't as bad and he would repair it the next day, along with a large chip on the corner of one of the pieces.  My mistake was providing Sinel with a check for the balance because he explained that Alice would make his life miserable if he returned without it.  He promised over and over again that he would be back first thing in the morning to repair the crack and chip.  Of course, he was a no show.  After numerous calls over several months and promise after promise to repair the crack and chip, he never showed,  After approximately a year of pursuing Sinel, I finally called and spoke with Lynda, Alice's daughter.  I told her that I would be posting negative comments about my experience on social media and she asked that I please give her the opportunity to correct the issue.  She scheduled a time to come to my home the following week to look at the crack and chip.  I actually took a day off from work and she never showed for the appointment at the promised time.  Multiple messages left asking to speak with her were unreturned.  It has now been approximately 18 months since the installation and the crack is getting worse and looks terrible.  I so wish I would've read the reviews on this site before deciding to do business with this firm.  It's apparent now that many people have also had terrible experiences and hopefully, others will learn from our mistakes and stay away.","DateTime":1512115278000,"Time_Only":"08:01:18","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"8","Date_Minute":"1"}

I was aware that it would be overpriced but I expected the quality of the whole experience to be better than that of say, a Red Lobster, but I actually think Red Lobster would have done a better job with customer service, the actual food prep and portion sizes, not to mention packaging. I expected a classic seafood restaurant experience at Legal Sea Foods, but I was somewhat disappointed. Yes I went during a high volume time, but I can't pardon some things. The food was served to us lukewarm, basically near cold. We went to the pickup counter because they was over an hour hold on seating, and then another thirty minutes to wait to take our food to go. After that kind of wait you expect hot fresh food. \n\nThe woman who took our order was a bit condescending and kept repeating and quoting prices to us and referring to how the menu is structure and that some items we wanted were \"premium menu items\". After the third time she did it, we gave her a look, and she still kept explaining, so I had to actually correct her and say, please just take the order, I want what I want and you have adequately explained this. Mind you the menu was right over our heads displayed in large enough print. It felt like she was insinuating we couldn't afford to eat there! Her implying we didn't want to pay the add on dish charges lent injury to the insult that we are African American and were the only customers who placed a takeout order after a couple of crowds left after being informed of the seating wait. After I put her in her place she apologized briskly and calculated the order and we went off to wait for it to be fulfilled. \n\nWhen we picked up the food, the manager came out and shook my hand and thanked us for our business. I am sure she told him that I remarked about her judgmental attitude and was probably scared I'd make an official complaint to upper company management. When we paid our $300+ bill and left, we got to our hotel only to realize that they had left off two side dishes we ordered and the food was cold, like it hadn't been just made. As far as the quality, the steamed lobsters were slightly overcooked and kind of small for the extra large stuffed lobster option, but still tender enough to bite and not truly rubbery. The lobster dressing was still tasty, but cold and you never want to microwave lobster. \n\nMy kale and yogurt dish was delicious, but a small serving, and inexplicably packed in a waxy coated cardboard box and the juices that weren't properly strained off were dripping into the bag and making a mess. They need to devise a better way of packaging to go orders or just stop doing it altogether. They can benefit from some customer service and diversity training for their entire staff and need to understand that the portion sizes are inadequate. I don't know if I'll give them a second chance yet, there are so many great seafood place in my area that I'll explore my options. I intended to give two stars but I added one just because the kale dish, was so good, even though it was a leaky mess and wasn't enough quantity and cold.","DateTime":1512116883000,"Time_Only":"08:28:03","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"8","Date_Minute":"28"}

I am a foodie and fan of the Top Chef show, so my visit to Boston was not going to go without a visit to this restaurant. I went in the middle of the day, after the lunch hour in hopes that the chef would be in. She was not and the entire restaurant was closed due to a private party leaving only the take out option. I spoke with ther manger, Emma, who was very kind and understanding; really she was fantastic and attentive.  I'm not going to lie, this still made me a little upset and I didn't know what I was going to do. I ended up going on a walk to Fenway park. The famous ball park was another must see as a lifetime baseball fan.\n\nI decided to go back and get the BBQ to go, strategically timing the completion of my order with the Lyft ride that I had ordered. This was to minimize the amount of time that my food, more specifically my biscuit, would have to cool off. Emma greeted me again while I was waiting, she is really great. When my food was done Emma personally delivered it to me and offered a metal fork as a \"souvenir\" since I was unable to meet the chef\/owner (Unfortunately this fork was taken away by hotel staff while I was working the next day). This was such a nice, thoughtful touch to a strange dining situation. I ordered the large platter (3 meats 2 sides) with brisket, pork belly and sausage. My side choices were the BBQ beans and potato salad. Most importantly, I also ordered the biscuit and honey butter, which is probably one of the most popular menu items. \n\nMy ride to the hotel only ended up being about 15 minutes. I must admit that my biscuit did not make it to the hotel, it was SO GOOD! I was quietly sitting in the back of my Lyft hoping that I wasn't being judged. My food was still warm and everything was really tasty! The pork belly was really smoky and crispy on top. The brisket had a great flavor and the sausage was very complex. The sides were good as well; the potato salad was not traditional and had a Moe refined flavor profile while the beans were fantastic in flavor but a little too hard for my liking. The biscuit and honey butter were amazing and lived up to the hype!

I'm a sucker for marketing, it works on me. (I also purchase wine solely based on if the label is \"cute\" so...yeah) This place is fairly new to our area. It used to be a sports bar that all I remember from my 3 visits were the green AstroTurf walls at the entry.  (Again, all about the decor.) I also remember that a week before that sports bar went out of business was our last visit & we should have known they were on their way out. They literally were \"out of\" lemons, napkins, our first 3 choices of bottled beers, and butter for our crab legs. How can you be out of butter? Walk to HEB & buy some sticks. Melt that ish & give it to me!\n\nI digress. So, Oasthouse....this little adorably named \"kitchen + bar\" popped up & we stopped in around 3pm on a Thursday after we went to the movie theater in the same parking lot. The Staff was super nice. I can't judge the food, since it was 3pm & I had just sat through 2.5 hours of a movie about Kate Winslet & some HOT dude being stuck in snowy mountains at a company event so adult beverages were not allowed, (And the HOT guy was clothed in layers for almost all of the 2.5 hour movie) so I needed a drink. \n\nMy 4 stars are broken down into\n\n5 STARS: for the non judgement from the 8 staff members (including the owners) when I rudely interrupted their little meeting by stumbling up to their table to demand someone take my order for my 6th glass of prosecco within 2 hours.\n\nMINUS 2 STARS: for the children running around me from the playground that still connects with a gate between this restaurant & the Mexican Restaurant across the playground.

Our waiter was totally lackadaisical, encouraging us to just order the buffet because it's busy and Sunday. And, discouraging certain drink orders, such as a Champagne Cocktail because he used to be a bartender and didn't know if the bartender knew how to make it. After providing the ingredients, guess what: still wrong! Guess he told me, huh! Lol The Pina Colada ordered by someone else in my party with raspberry liquor was a disaster. The waiter actually argued with her about taking it off the bill, even though she didn't accept or taste the drink!! Seriously? The service was inconsistent, dishes rarely cleared, drinks refilled for some and. not others. Of course, near the end of the meal, he became nicer, refilling drinks and complimenting us. Too little too late mister mediocre service! Oh, yeah, back to the food, while the buffet variety was good, the food was absolutely unremarkable and generally flavorless. The deserts looked better than they tasted, which is good for my waistline! The ham was dry and sadly there were just a few New Orleans specialties on the buffet. Where was the gumbo, shrimp and grits and good jambalaya? cheese grits were tasty. I won't be back and I don't recommend.

Whether it was just me not wanting to cook and enjoying the best happy hour menu in town, or when family was visiting we loved to show this place off as our local spot. After about Two years of patronage I started being treated poorly by just one of the bartenders. I live in this neighborhood and I will be the first person to let you know there are some unsavory and lost people out in this area. Over the years you encounter them in your stores or restaurants, (or if you are super unlucky like we were, sleeping in the car). I try and be patient, maybe help with the tab if that is the issue, coax them outside and out of servers hair when I have the guts. I can honestly say I never thought anyone would ever accuse me or treat me like a vagrant, especially after years of frequent business. I have never had a problem with any other employee, never have I had any trouble paying my bill or done anything that would result in me being asked to leave and not come back. So understand my shock when I was yelled at in front of other regulars. At this time i was not given a reason as to why I was not allowed there. Just told to leave and in a  condensending tone assured that I knew why. I asked to speak to a manager when I was told he was the manager and then asked for a number to call the owner. This was not a normal conversation you would ever see between a patron and employee. I was called fat and told i could go for a few less happy hours and I was physically placed outside. All by the one and only employee who was waging his causeless war against me.  Sometime later a friend was having their party there and truly thinking nothing of it, I attended. Everything was great! Food,beer,music selection and over all vibe was awesome. I did not notice when he walked in but the next thing I know I was being called a loser and when my friends cone to my aid he tells my friends that I had been kicked out for using drugs on the property. I leave bawling. Tonight my boyfriend went in to grab a beer. Now ....he has never been asked to leave . He is a shy guy so when he was approached in the presence of strangers by a very aggressive angry man he was not only confused but embarrassed. He was followed out and told that the reason I am not allowed there is because I STOLE a phone from a deaf person as well as a credit card. When I was told this I went over the edge. 1st I have never stolen from a person in my life and 2nd I happen to dedicate my work hours helping people with different disabilities assisting vocational therapists.  SHAME ON YOU! ! When my phone was stolen from your bar I was told the video was unattainable. When my window to my car was broken out and my school bag stolen I was told the camera probably didn't catch that angle.  I am not sure why you chose to not like me but regardless there is a way to handle situations professionally. When I think about all the people who I had enjoyed conversation with or swapped favorites off the menu or picked songs off  juke box with seeing me as a  thief and a bad person it hurts and it is embarrassing. No evidence, no reason, not fair. You enjoyed making me cry and that is wrong. Find a way to take out your anger in ways that don't hurt innocent people so badly. It may not seem like a big deal to you but you also were not the one being shamed for something as horrible as what you were publicly accusing me of. I hope the guy who I guess is a friend of hours  wisens up and gets rid of you. From what everyone else says you have never been liked much by patrons or employees alike. Didn't you guys use to own a bar together back in the day? Now you are just wiping down bars and calling someone boss. You have no right to make anyone feel that way especially at your place of employment. I can only prey you are reprimanded or at least asked to produce some evidence so that you are the one looking like an idiot.","DateTime":1512128633000,"Time_Only":"11:43:53","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"11","Date_Minute":"43"}

Some of us want to have some quality time, not just get drunk.\n\nThe pricing for the tour is also a little bizarre. I bought my tickets online and I got the more expensive tickets so we could get the 5 ounce glass.

Come to find out that when you walked into the tour everyone is given a little glass for tasting. The tour itself was pretty quick but I would say just enough and I appreciated the three tastings we got along the way. The tour guide was funny but clearly a little drunk. \n\nAt the end you are ushered into the store. Remember those glasses? I went up to the bar to see if I could get a tasting of the limited beer and when I told that bartender something about the tickets and the glasses he asked me if I had boggt thise tickets.

Very fresh and the balsamic played perfectly with the mozz! \n\nMy wife got the Pettini di Mare and said that the scallops were cooked perfectly. The risotto is seasonal and hers was a pumpkin risotto and was unique. I did actually enjoy that as well. I got the Pasta alla Bolognese and it was phenomenal! Big thick homemade noodles and that short rib!? That short rib was so succulent. This was one of the best Bolognese I've ever had. We finished it off with a dessert of Zeppoli. Essentially it is an italian \"donut\" if you will. Fried dough. This was the least favorite dish of the night. We thought the bread was way to dense. We were hoping for a light and airy piece of bread. Was not awful just was not that great.\n\nThis place really is worth a trip. Again it is on the pricey side. Our waiter was prompt. Low lighting made for a nice setting. A great place to take your wife or girlfriend on a date.

Know that this is a super-market experience. It's a large office, very busy. They do attempt to be efficient -- like a supermarket -- but the overall feel is that of an assembly line. And you will be in multiple lines.\nSuggestions: Don't book appointments when you are rushed. Be very patient, expect extra time for lines, paperwork, waiting, and so on. Don't expect personal attention. If you're self-aware and really just want PT, get a referral from your Primary and save time. If your kid broke their arm, and it's fairly routine, this is probably ok. Routine stuff is probably ok, just expect long waits. For deeper stuff, give it some thought.\nI've had three experiences here. First was for lower back pain. The physician never touched or tested me in any way. He asked maybe 2 questions, and said steroid injections might help. I'm active, athletic, and was not looking for surgery or drugs, but for help. He basically shrugged his shoulders. He wasn't interested in working with me.\nThe second experience was for a hamstring injury. Waiting room: 20 minutes. Wait in examining office: 45 minutes. Time with physician: 2 minutes. He said hamstring was very difficult, probably wouldn't go away, that he himself has had it persistently for years. Suggested a drug, but said side effects might not be good. I went to PT, and solved the problem on my own.\nThird experience was minor outpatient surgery for foot. Initial consult was about 1 minute.\nIt is difficult to get through via phone to this practice. You will always have at least four menu items to get through, and a good chance of being put on hold for several minutes. The office staff are ok, but not particularly friendly.

I got the meatball and she had the pastrami hand pies. I was going to get the steak and cheese but they were out the day I went. \n\nThe pizza was good but lacked a crispy bottom. Small sample size since I have only been here once but although it lacked the crispy bottom for a thin crust pizza I found myself enjoying the flavorful thin layer that people would criticize. I do enjoy crispy thin crust pizzas but I didn't mind the soggy layer for this pizza and I'm unsure why! The chicken was finely chopped and mixed into the cheese which I thought was a very good idea. It was a bit on the saltier side so next time I'll ask for less sauce and to aid the lack of crispness I will ask for less cheese as well. In the photo you can see it was generously topped. \n\nThe hand pies are the reason I came to grab food here. I've never had one and seemed like a fun idea. They were really good in my opinion. The meatball wasn't dried out and the pastrami was packed with flavor, especially when you got toward the last bit where all the juices flowed to. I will definately come back and see the overly welcomkng owner who is also the chef of this spot. This place is more of a takeout spot due to the very small interior.

I have l over in my house for two years, and nothing but problems. Now that happens, to me it's all about how the company handles them. Invitation homes customer service and management is no only terrible but the companies they hire to fix issues is even worst then them. They have sent out contractors to fix a reoccurring leak in my roof, I had to get irritated every time I called it in because they constantly drug their feet. Then the reoccurring part is because they send companies out that fix everything in a cheap way so that they have to keep coming back out and you must keep taking off work. One roofing company took my boyfriend's materials and used it to fix the roof! There has been a company that came to fix something with the drain, needed to go to Home depot and then never came back, for other issues I was told I'd be contacted by a contractor on another issue and the contractor decided just to show up in the morning without calling and wanting to work. When I moved in there were nails all over my yard. One went through my shoe into my foot after I called their maintenance staff to come out and clean their yard up, luckily my dogs didn't get injured. The worst one of all where this unprofessional company actually let their negligent self be a health concern: we had a pipe just in one of our bathrooms. When we had gotten home there was probably about 70 gallons of water which went through the flooring and into the crawl space below. We notfied the company, we told them itrs an emergency and someone needs to get out right away because after a 24 hour period we will have hold growth. They drug their feet again and the whole floor  was covered wall to wall with mold because of their negligence go fix a important problem. When after we told them their was mold they still weren't in any hurry to get someone out here. I told them at the time I had a 6 month old and threatened to report them and fix myself and Bill them and they only referred me to my lease where I can't do that. It took FOUR DAYS TO GET Someone out knowing there was mold now!\nThem their third party companies they sent out said they weren't given permission to rip out the subfloori ng and a couple other things to do the job correctly. So now to the best part. Since Invitation Homes rents most of the rental around me. I decided possibly just staying one more year before we buy a house. Well I called into the office a few days ago wanting to know when I would get my email about how much and when I have to make a decision by wether I would like to stay or not. No call back, I called back yesterday and I was told they were not renewing my lease and it was a a management decision. Really? So I'm the one here who pays 1474 a month never in the two years I've lived here have a had a late payment and I'm the one who has had to deal with the issues I have to point of one that was a health hazard and you are going to tell me I have to move! I hope people realize this companies true colors. I was told the supervisor would call me yesterday and again no call. It sounds exactly like retaliation not being willing to renew my lease which is illegal. Then to add a lasting impression for any curious home searchers, the company has reviewed my review I have left and messaged me asking for my contact information which I gave right away, and still no contact has been made. I have made several attempts a few days ago all the way up to today. Way to stand by exactly what I have said above.","DateTime":1512137715000,"Time_Only":"14:15:15","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"14","Date_Minute":"15"}

We put our name on the wait list at 8 and got sat right after 8:30. We sat at a two top on an elevated section filled with about 6 HUGE TVs, my game was on two of them in just the areas to hurt my neck. Requested our server, Aaron, to put the game on a tv right in front of us and wish granted! My fianc\u00e9 got two beers on draft, about $9 a piece, cold, crisp, and quite a good selection to choose from. Even got to sample their house beer, ended up getting one. I got a cocktail called the Crimson Derby, this was legit the only downside of our visit, for $12 it was tiny (about 6 oz) and pretty weak. I expected a little more punch from a pricey cocktail, but that's why I only got one. So the food was BOMB! We started with the fried Wisconsin cheese (recommendation by our fantastic server Aaron), the best cheese curds I've ever had, very plentiful and served with a tasty tomato jam. Next we went with another great recommendation, the grilled mojo lime chicken wings, tangy, garlicky and full of flavor! I felt a little guilty for taking up our server's table for over 2.5 hours but Aaron took his time with us, didn't rush us, gave us some great tips for citywalk and had some really great conversation too! My Cowboys were up and the game was almost over, we decided to grab one more little bite before we left, tots with a side of their white queso, best tots or queso I've had in a while! Overall a wonderful experience, exceptional service, delicious food and drink and the best sports bar atmosphere around. Highly recommended if you want some good food and a place to watch your team!

So when looking for a cozy place to sit a moment before heading out of town, I happily found Darwin's in my path.\n\nThe cafe still has its relaxed yet polished vibe with natural wood counters and muted pastel walls, but they've expanded into the storefront next door. It's a well needed change that gives tons more space for actual tables and even a loft seating area.\n\nIn addition to coffee, tea, and sandwiches\/salads, they also serve wine and local Lamplighter beer. It's not happy hour yet, but I'll be coming back for it. \n\nI went for my usual matcha latte with almond milk, which tasted just as good as usual -- a strong matcha flavor without being overly bitter, grassy, or powdery.\n\nTheir drinks are a bit more expensive than before and compared to surrounding cafes (for instance, an 8 oz matcha was $3.75 with a hefty $1 for almond milk).\n\nIf coffee is more your thing, they do a pretty good cup, too. They use Square One beans, but currently have Speckled Ax as their guest espresso (super delicious, from Portland, Maine).\n\nAs for food, gluten free bread is one major reason why I'll forsake my usual paleo ways to get a sandwich.

It was barely cut, so trying to pull apart slices turned everything into a sloppy cheese-less piece of soggy tomato bread. Which was weird because the cheese was still steaming hot when I got it, it was like it was cooked by a heat gun from the top down.

The sauce was good, cheese was good, not sure what exactly it was missing.

This airport is huge and like a rat maze, it is so convoluted that you wonder if the design team were masochists or a bunch of drunk college kids.\n\nOn my most recent arrival, I was flying in from England. I do understand that arriving internationally into any airport you need to tack on extra time to go through customs. That was not the problem here, the line was short to get my passport scanned although there were a lot of people who could not figure it out. Technology and kiosks scare a lot of people and their brain freezes so they just stand there. After scanning my passport, I went to pick up my luggage. That is when mayhem called my name into the time vortex. I picked up my luggage and followed a mass amount of people into a series of hallways, escalators, elevators, stairs, etc. With our luggages! Most airports that I have flown into internationally, you pick up your luggage and go through one hallway or no hallway and you see the light of day. I walked so much dragging my luggage, making turns left, right and I may have possibly walked in a circle. I went up escalators with my luggage and I know I took elevators to avoid another series of steps. How below ground was I?\n\nBy the time I got out and hopped onto the car rental shuttle that was already there almost an hour and twenty minutes had gone by.

After multiple attempts to dine here, it finally happened! \n\nAppearance: The interior of the restaurant is very nice. There seems to be a couple private areas for patrons to slip off their shoes and dine. There are multiple wooded booths for groups as well. The seatings in the middle are pretty tight. But the tables are sectioned off pretty well so you don't see patrons on the other side. \n\nFood: The menu offers a wide variety of foods which I was thankful for since I came with my friend owho's not into raw fish. I ordered the Bonsai Roll ($9), which was really tasty. I didn't like the sauce this roll came with (which I think it was ponzu sauce), so I asked for spicy mayo instead. The sushi rice was soft and fish was fresh, but the roll was kind of small so I had to order another roll-- the Super Crunchy Shrimp Roll ($9). This one wasn't very different from other Super Crunch Rolls I've had previously. We also ordered Shrimp Spring Roll ($8) and Sakusaku Shrimp ($9). The first was good however, there were only 3 shrimp spring rolls..that's $2.66\/spring roll. I thought there would be atleast 5, so we were disappointed especially since there wasn't anything special about the spring rolls. Just tempera shrimp wrapped in the egg roll wrappers. The Sakusaku shrimp was decent, neither one of us liked the mayonnaise-based sauce they used. Thankfully we asked the sauce to be on the side. So in a way, we ended up eating plain fried shrimp instead. \n\nOverall, I was slightly disappointed. Maybe it was because I walked in having high expectations after reading the many good reviews and such. I had a good experience here, but overhyped.","DateTime":1512141135000,"Time_Only":"15:12:15","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"15","Date_Minute":"12"}

I'm a sucker for poutine so I knew this would be a great place. They have tons of condiments (hence the name) and a variety of sandwiches plus a few varieties of poutine. We went for the classic version because it seemed better for my arteries. They do have a loaded poutine called Beast Mode which  has every topping on it and the group sitting next to us ordered it. All I can say is, yikes! It was gigantic and probably a good idea to be shared among 4 people. My sandwich was the herb roasted chicken sandwich to go with our fries. It had a crispy bun, coleslaw, apple, and pickles on it. There were so many flavors going on and I loved every bite. My dining partner got the kimchi fried chicken which I took a bite of and I wish I had ordered that too. It had the tangy bite from the kimchi along with the crispy fried chicken. Both sandwiches were perfection. It made me wish that I lived closer to Boston so I could go here all the time, but it's probably best to keep my poutine intake to a minimum. I highly recommend visiting Saus the next time you're in Boston.","DateTime":1512142101000,"Time_Only":"15:28:21","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"15","Date_Minute":"28"}

Because it hit the spot and because of friendliness.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI was staying nearby for a couple days for work and noticed that Foxtail had some great reviews for coffee, nearby. It's inside of a bank building, so don't think you're going to see it from the street, like I did. Fortunately, there was plenty of street parking available, so I snagged a spot and found my way to the coffee.\n\nI've been drinking a boring ol' double shot of espresso lately, which doesn't tend to vary too much from place to place, as it depends more on the bean itself. I enjoyed my double shot, but more so what stuck out to me was the friendliness of the barista.\n\nI'm always amazed when people in the service industry seem to not enjoy interacting with the human race. I get it that everyone has bad days, but I always wonder why it's so hard for some people to just be semi-nice to customers for the 3.5 minutes that you're forced to interact with them. Even if we're dealing with a worst-case-annoying-level customer, you prepare their coffee, hand them their coffee and get their payment for the coffee, before they are out of your life forever.\n\nThe fella at Foxtail should teach a class on how to master this art. It's not like he did anything drastic -\u00a0he just could not have been more cordial and friendly during our brief interaction. He seemed to genuinely love his job.\n\nSo, guy who worked here the morning of November 8th, you're awesome.

I tried buying used Honda Accord from here.  They pressured me into buying a new Toyota Camry to reach their monthly quota after I told them specifically what car I wanted.  After two days of research and test driving, I liked a Honda Accord and talked to the financial department about a loan.  They ran my credit so many times, my credit score dropped drastically.  After \"checking\" my credit, they pre-approved me for a loan that had a 8% interest rate.  I called my bank immediately after and they provided me with 2.2% interest rate. Before signing any papers and signing the car in my name, I went to Honda in West Roxbury where I spent less than one hour before signing papers to purchase a car.  I went back to Toyota to get my check back for the car and the GM told me they have the right not to give my check back (after they made me wait 45 minutes).  I had to threaten to call my lawyer before he told me he would give me back my check in 4 days.  I asked to speak to someone else immediately after. Another manager on duty finally gave me my check back.

When my friend and I moved to the bar, I asked the bartender to make me something different and cool just not with bourbon. What I got back was a cup of salty water. The first drink was bearable but the second drink was downright awful. My friend didn't like her two drinks either so we decided to go to another bar. The reason why I am even giving this place any stars is that we got an order of olives and they were the best olives I had ever tasted. My friend is Italian and said these were better than her grandma's olives. Fair warning though, it was $6 for 6 olives. Prices here are super steep in general. My cocktails were $14 and were about 3 gulps each. You can also get a burger and fries for $19 and $9 respectively.","DateTime":1512144155000,"Time_Only":"16:02:35","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"16","Date_Minute":"2"}

If she was, she would have called her back to discuss this matter additionally since she was so rude and abrasive! She would tried to come to a mutually acceptable resolution. She didn't. So to scam my friend out of $100 for flimsy pieces of plastic and then being condescendingly rude and dismissive when my friend was calm just proves what a horrible business owner she is. She is NOT about her customers or providing a quality service, regardless of what she claims!!! \n\nTOTAL SCAM ARTISTS! If I could give a half a star, I would. My friend placed an order for a formal event she was having and while their desserts were decent, their business practices are shady at best. We went through the rigmarole of renting a macaroon holder, only to be told that it required a $100 deposit. So when I went to pick up the order for my friend, imagine my surprise when I picked up 5 flimsy pieces of plastic! I was expecting something more extravagant to justify such a large deposit! When the event planner setup the dessert station, lo and behold the flimsy macaroon stand would not actually hold together securely once the macarons were placed on it. And at some point in the night the top completely fell off and got lost. Nonethesless, my friend went out of her way to return the remaining pieces of the holder so that they could at least reuse the other pieces. However, the owner absolutely refused to return her deposit!!!!  And in further speaking with her, she said that she makes it a practice to go out and buy a new ones anyway, so my friend requested that out of good practice that she just simply return to her the remainder of her deposit after buying a whole new stand. Mind you, these cheap, plastic stands cost about $20 at most. The owner absolutely refused to honor this request!!!! So, she is out buying five new crappy plastic stands with my friend's money to scam more people out of their $100!!!  They are a total racket, and the owner was EXTREMELY RUDE to my friend (I witnessed their entire exchange). My friend and I will never ever go here again or recommend anybody use this place.

For lovers of rice, ahi, kani, avocado, and sauce, this is the winning combination! \n\nOverall, the quality of food isn't the highest but their portions, pricing, and the Ahi Tower may lure me back!","DateTime":1512145286000,"Time_Only":"16:21:26","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"16","Date_Minute":"21"}

Our food items included the pork carnitas nachitos, street chicken quesadillas, 2 orders of pulpo ajo tacos, hot chicken tacos, and Mexican fried rice. Of all the dishes, I highly recommend the Mexican fried rice, it was such a creative and flavorful dish! I would strongly suggest skipping the street chicken quesadillas because even though it was a unique twist on a quesadilla, the result was very bland. The place was super busy and it was hard to flag down our waitress. This normally wouldn't be a problem but she had gotten our orders wrong a few times.

The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is absolutely stunning. This was Universal's saving grace when their numbers were so low and losing money rapidly. The Hogsmeade\/Hogwarts side of the park is on the Islands of Adventure side and the Diagon Ally side is on the Studio side. You can ride the Hogwarts express between the two (keep in mind you will need a park-to-park ticket) as many times as you'd like throughout the day. \n\nLet us start with the Hogsmeade\/Hogwarts side. This was the OG. The beginning of the Harry Potter world for Universal. The first time you walk in you are blown away by the detail and the beauty within. Your first stop is a picture with the train conductor of Hogwarts Express. Once you walk in to your left is Honeydukes and to your right is the (now closed) Dragon Challenge. A new ride is set to open here in 2019. There have been rumors of a ride using floo powder or perhaps the Forbidden Forest. This ride is not a loss to the park. It wasn't built for Harry Potter, it was rebranded and has been there since the park opened in 1999. The queues for this ride have been minimal over the last few years, leading Universal to the decision to close it. Directly between Dragon Challenge and Honeydukes you will find Butterbeer! Butterbeer is amazing. I recommend the regular Butterbeer so you are able to get the traditional Butterbeer stache picture. Also the vanilla froth they put on top is heavenly. I always eat that before I drink my drink. \n\nAcross from the nonexistent Dragon Challenge is the Three Broomsticks and the Hogs Head. The Three Broomsticks is awesome to go in because it reminds you exactly of what the books described it as. You can get reservations from breakfast when you do a package and I highly recommend doing that because this place is smaller and can get really busy and does not have a ton of seating. \n\nPast the shops you will find Ollivander's Wand Experience on your right. Now, there's a 95% chance you won't get chosen to be the person that gets the experience but it is very cool to see nonetheless. There is an Ollivander's in both parks so if the lines are long for this one you can always wait to go in Diagon Ally. If all you want is to buy a wand you don't need to do the wand experience to get a wand.  You can go into the store from another entrance.  After you come out of Ollivander's it is time to go on the Flight of the Hippogriff! This was rebranded from the Old Flying Unicorn and is a quick and small child's rollercoaster. The ride itself only lasts less than a minute so unless you've never been on or there is a short wait time I would skip this one.  You actually get some amazing views of the park overall on this ride so for that reason it is also worth going on once.  Past the Flight of the Hippogriff you will find a stage that has a frog choir performing on it.  \n\nOnce you past that you will see the Castle!  If you want to go on the ride Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey you will need to lock all your items up in a locker.  The locker areas can be a bit overwhelming.  Even if you don't want to do the ride I highly recommend walking through because the queue is absolutely breathtaking.  The first part of the queue is the greenhouse. This part can seem the longest and warmest on a busy day.  However, once you get inside the castle it is beautiful.  If you can take your time as you walk through to see all the details that are located within the castle.  Now this ride I will warn you is nauseating.  I have heard from multiple people (as well as myself) this is the type of ride that people who don't normally get sick on rides will get sick on. You are placed in rollercoaster like seats sideways (with the bars over you) and you are turned in every direction possible.  Sometimes in very slow motion.  So keep this in mind when you decide if you want to do the ride. Once you finish the ride you will be taken into a gift shop.  This is one of the biggest shops inside this side of the Potter world. Once you finish here it is time to take the train to Diagon Ally!","DateTime":1512145927000,"Time_Only":"16:32:07","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"16","Date_Minute":"32"}

You will walk back through Hogsmeade (the other exit takes you out by Jurassic Park) and go to the train station.  Have your ticket ready to scan, it makes the process go faster.  Once you scan your ticket you will be able to walk through to the train.  It is a bit of a walk but normally the queue itself moves relatively fast.  You will be able to watch a show on the windows going to and from Hogsmeade. Make sure to ride the train both ways because the show on the screens is different both ways. \nAlso if you are taking the train from London to Hogsmeade pay close attention to when you cross Platform 9 3\/4. It is a great video moment where you can \"disappear\" through the wall. \nWhen you arrive in London you arrive in Kings Cross Station.  Once you walk out of Kings Cross Station you will be in London.  The Knight Bus (including talking heads) and the Fountain of Fair Fortune is placed outside.  Walking a little past you will find Number 12 Grimmauld Place.  If you stand long enough you will be able to see Kreacher peak out the window.  Once you walk into Diagon Ally prepare to be amazed. When you walk in to the left is The Leaky Cauldron and to your right is Quality Quidditch Supplies. Now is where you take your time and explore everything Diagon Ally has to offer. The ride Escape from Gringotts is the very best. (See my review for that on that page).  The Butterbeer is located inside so you don't have to get overheated while waiting for it. If you need time to cool off step into Knockturn Ally where it is very dark and very air conditioned.  It is also a short cut to get out of the land if you wish. \nDiagon Ally is a great place to spend a lot of time just walking around and observing all of the detail that was put into it. Check out the sign for Obscurus Books, or walk on the side of Magical Menagerie and see the giant snake.  The Leaky Cauldron is a great place to eat, or stop in Ollivander's to get chosen for a wand. You can also go into Gringotts and exchange your dollars for wizard money. You can even go into Madam Malkin's and get fitted for your own robes. \nThe dragon will breathe fire every ten minutes and I encourage you to see it both in the day and the night. Save your money because you will want to buy everything in the Wizarding World.","DateTime":1512145960000,"Time_Only":"16:32:40","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"16","Date_Minute":"32"}

The sauce was a bit too sweet for me, but no worries as there is an ample amount of jasmine rice and salad to help tame the flavor.\n\nF.O.T. musubi- I liked how they turned these into rolls, very saucy, but fun take on the traditional spam musubi.\n\nPhoenix Eggrolls- 2 per order, extra long, deliciously stuffed with pork and crab, fried to perfection and paired perfectly with the sweet chili sauce.\n\nKorokke-I love croquettes and you get two massive crispy ones per order, quite dericious, with a hint of curry and refreshing with the salad \n\nNi-Haowdy fries-similar to Bruce Lee, but instead of rice, you get a butt ton of delicious fries, definitely a crowd pleaser!\n\nI can't wait to come back to try more of their menu, and next time will for sure try some of their house-brewed teas and coffees and their infamous dragonbeard candy!","DateTime":1512146155000,"Time_Only":"16:35:55","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"16","Date_Minute":"35"}

My dog was authorized to be an emotional support dog from my husband. Which has a terminal illness and was in a horrible car accident the week before in Florida. The ticket agent in fort Myers  would not take the letter from his primary care doctor. She  indicated it didn't have the proper letterhead and signature from the doctor.

As we walked in, the restaurant looked a little small but was a nice size. We were asked if we had a reservation which we didn't, so we decided to sit at the bar so we wouldn't take up any tables a reserved spot may have needed. As we sat at the bar we were greeted by the sweetest bartenders! My friend bought a drink, a lychee martini which was one of the best I've had! And believe me I've had quite a few lychee martinis. I was really hungry so I ordered the lobster wontons for an appetizer and they were absolutely delicious! The creaminess of the lobster with a little kick combined with the sweet sauce on top with the saltiness of the caviar was the best bite of a wonton I've ever had! If Chinese restaurants could replace crab rangoons for this wonton I would eat it every day!! As for dinner, I ordered a steak medium rare, which came with a sundried tomato crust and wasabi mashed potatoes. The crust on the steak was a perfect amount of crunch and flavor and the steak itself was extremely juicy! The wasabi mashed potatoes were amazing as well, with the normal taste of potatoes with a very subtle taste of wasabi. My friend ordered the fried chicken and lobster mac and cheese, however she is extremely allergic to shellfish so had to order it without the lobster (therefore I had the appetizer all to myself, not complaining at all here). The fried chicken was HUGE!! I was quite surprised! It also came with fried seaweed on top which she asked me if she was supposed to eat or not and proceeded to eat all of it. I never had a chance to try her food but she said it was AMAZING. Unfortunately, upon getting our food we got into a knife and fork fight with our food and tried to finish our food off mortal kombat style and our food unfortunately ended up finishing us.

Snooze is the Sh**!! Like for real though. Their food is badass. And they have badass salsa. In my opinion you can't survive as a breakfast spot in Texas without these two things as a minimum. They have some of the best hashbrowns I've ever had, Their orange juice is fresh squeezed and I just literally freaking love this joint. The biggest downfalls of this place and I'm sure what most people complain about are:\n\n1. The parking. The parking sucks ass. I usually have to drive around the entire span of this shopping center or whatever it is where the restaurant is.  \n\n2. The wait. LONG ASS LINE every single time you go. But WTF every other breakfast place is below them. People will stand in line at Franklins for 6 hrs and swear it was worth it when there's at least 6 other BBQ places in town that are better and have zero wait. All you have to do is ask the front person how long the wait is. If you don't wanna wait then bounce. Pretty simple.\n\nFirst off there's nothing they can really do about the parking situation. Lets face it every place in South central Austin has a parking problem since 78704 got so densely popular. It is what it is. Every bar in the '04 has minimal parking and it dosen't really effect you if you go out drinking and you are calling uber or lyft to get around. But to go eat, yea. \n\nSecondly There is probably no one on earth that loathes waiting in line as much as I do. However, if you go on a weekday you can usually slide right in with no or a minimal wait. This place in my opinion did everything right. I like the colors, I like the natural light, I like that they have an outside area, I like that they installed the rollup windows for summer. And most importantly their food is the shit. \n\nI live in Travis heights and this is the BEST breakfast spot in the '04 without a doubt. Take it from a native. CHECK THEM OUT.

Sure, it's not the prettiest eating establishment. But I don't care since I take my wings to-go so nobody can see me chewing on the cartilage (no waste in my house).

I can eat these happily without the sauce.\"\n\nWe ordered 40 wings, half lemon pepper and half garlic pepper. For 20 wings it's $14.99 without tax, which comes to about $0.75 per wing. To me, this is a great deal. In San Diego I had to wait until Wing Wednesdays to get good quality wings for this cheap so I'm a pretty happy camper these days. \n\nThe wings were extra crispy and the lemon pepper was perfectly balanced--not too salty or lemony. The garlic was delicious as well.

So I waited TWO WEEKS working on my feet all day in pain to get in for an appointment on my one day off and paid a $20 copay when he or the office could have called and told me that and not wasted my time. When I sent Dr Ronick a message directly, he did not have the courtesy to reply and instead some random office person emailed that I was \"paying for the consult\" - which was a LIE. I came in not for a consult but for a procedure (it's in writing on the appointment request online, and he did not lift a finger to help, just happily took my money and ripped me off. When you are stretched financially as it is, it is particularly disgusting to see unethical behavior like this go on and on and not only have I told the office (because god forbid Ronick get off his arse and respond to patients himself) that he's no longer my doctor, we have reached out to Providence and our insurance company to file a formal complaint against this office.

For those of you that have a car, read the paragraph at the bottom before you try to get a license, as you'll get turned away from the DMV.\n\nRegarding the DMV, it says that you can sign in online to save time and \"skip the line.\"  I can't say how that worked, because although they open at 8am, I tried to sign in online several times starting around 7:30am, and it told me that no online check in was available.  When I arrived at the DMV at 8:10am I asked why, and they said that online check in opens at 6am, and that all of the slots had probably already been given out.  \n\nNot sure if it's different at other times of the day, but I had arrived at 4pm on a Thursday (the day before) to get in line in person, and they said it was a minimum 170 minute wait at that point.  They close at 5pm, but if you're in before 5pm, they will get to you eventually.  Upon arriving at 8:10am on Friday the next day, my ticket said L4015, and they were calling L4006.  They called about 30 other numbers starting with A, S, N, etc., and then eventually my number was called at 9:00am.  I was done and out of the DMV by 9:10am, one hour after arriving.\n\nRegarding documentation, I was turned away that Thursday the first time I went because you need to bring either your original social security card (honestly, who has that?), or a COPY of your W-2 or 1099 that shows your SSN.  You cannot bring a copy of your social security card, and you cannot show them a W-2 on your phone or email it (you must print that out ahead of time).  Supposedly there is a library down the road you can print those documents out if you need to.  Regarding proof of residency, it was really easy: if your car insurance shows your TX address, you can use that, plus your car registration, and not have to worry about bills or other proof of residence.  \n\nIf, like me, you've lost your current out of state drivers license, you do not have to take the written and driving test (which it says you have to do if you don't have an out of state license to turn in).  They just looked up my active IL drivers license online.  I brought my passport for identification and had no problems with that.  Also, I read in a review it said to bring a check, but a credit card was accepted with no problem (I think it was about $20).  They give you a xerox copy of your new drivers license and send you the original in the mail in about 2 weeks.\n\nFor out of state car owners:  You need to get your car registered before you can apply for a drivers license.  In order to get your car registered, you have to take it for emissions and safety testing first, then go to the County Tax Office (Travis County has three locations; if you get a personalized plate, you buy it online, and it gets sent to the Main location a few weeks after it's ordered; in the meantime, they'll give you a randomly picked plate at any location).  You need proof of car insurance to get the inspections done, and if it's out of state car insurance, you also need to take the declaration page to the tax office (unlike at the DMV, it's ok to just show it to them on your phone if you didn't print it out).  You'll also need a passport or drivers license for identification, and either title or previous out of state registration.  It came to about $200 for registration and sticker, and I was in and out in about 15 minutes.  Also, good to note, but it says online that you only have to get your car inspected if it's more than two years old, but apparently in Travis county, you have to get it inspected regardless of how old it is.","DateTime":1512151300000,"Time_Only":"18:01:40","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"18","Date_Minute":"1"}

Their espresso and coffee is also okay - I would prefer a stronger, bolder flavor. \n\nHowever, there is one thing I cannot take credit away from them that sets them apart from any other cafe - their extensive vegan options. They have a separate vegan menu that you have to ask the people behind the counter for.

I wrote to the company and their online support person seemed to want to help but they didn't really want to talk to me. They'd rather copy paste long scripts of text and tell me 'just read what it says.' I can read. I'm not an idiot. If I wanted an online tutorial, I'd just look one up. So after a few minutes of being told to just read the long script, I had to stop them from jumping to conclusions and say 'there seems to be a miscommunication, that isn't my problem.' I had to go all over the house to deal with alarm settings. I had to punch in codes. I had to do more work than the representative was doing. Beyond that, after everything was said and done, the alarm still wasn't registering. Her response to me was, Oh well then we need to get you a new alarm. It's $99.00 but you get it free .....just pay for shipping. Now, I'm not a mean person but I'd lost my patience at this point. I said, 'No thank you. Have a good day.' She was confused by this. 'What do you mean? I don't understand. You don't want a FREE alarm?\" \nI said, no because it isn't free. I shouldn't be making monthly payments for my house to be alarmed --to have an alarm not working at all. The company should be embarrassed they're sending out faulty products and charging me for services that I'm then not receiving because of their alarms. To then tell me they want to charge me to replace their faulty alarms is quite upsetting.

Sat at the bar, service was prompt and with a cool (read: not too warm) politeness, which I thought was ok for a hipster joint in Chinatown.\n\nOrdered a couple of beers and shared 4 pieces of fried chicken (two spicy, two not), and a side of dirty fries. The fried chicken had a really crispy (and gluten-free) skin, and it wasn't dry or anything.. but to be honest it also wasn't very mindblowing or even very memorable. I think the chicken was pre-made, so it was kinda lukewarm. I think it would be a lot better if they were more made to order (kind of what I expect for a restaurant rather than a fast food joint).\n\nThe dirty fries were ok too, pretty decent portion (well for $9 I would expect that).\n\nPrices were ok I guess, made sense for the vibe and the fact it's a sit-down restaurant. \nI think for me it's not really a must-visit.

The earliest time for pickup was 12:00-12:15 and it was 11:25. While not ideal, I could make this work, so I selected this time. After I added items to my order, I went back to add two items. It took me less than a minute. I went back to the order page, made sure my order was correct and hit submit after entering my payment info. As it was processing, I noticed the pickup time had changed to 12:15-12:30. This wouldn't work for me due to scheduling and so I looked to see if there was a cancel order button, there was not. So, I tried calling. The first call went directly to voicemail without ringing. The voicemail box was full. I tried again. It rang about 4-5 times and went to the full voicemail again. I tried calling for 30 minutes. I got through a couple of times without answer, but for the most part it went directly to voicemail. Annoyed, I went to get my order at noon. It took 5 minutes to walk there. My order was in the window, but the girl behind the counter didn't even acknowledge me, though she looked right at me. She proceeded to help some men who had walked up after me. Granted, she was at the other end of the counter from where online pickup was, but she didn't even say she would be with me momentarily. I stood there for about 5 minutes and another girl came up from behind me and went through the counter door. She had money in her hand, and went to the register closest to me. She didn't acknowledge me. Still with money in her hand she went to the other girl who was still taking that group of people's order. They were joking around with them. By this time, I had been standing there for about 10 minutes without acknowledgement. I couldn't just walk away as my card had already been charged from ordering online. Finally, the girl holding the money went to the window and got my order. She asked my name and I said that it was me. She brought me my order and I said that I had ordered a drink also. She asked me why I wanted and I told her unsweet tea. She proceeds to open the locked cabinet to put the money in a cash bag. After she was done, she went to get my beverage, asking again what drink I wanted. She brought it over to me and said thanks and that was it. This was the worst experience I've ever had at Grindhouse and at this location, in particular. I won't be going back. The only reason they got two stars from me is because the food was ok. My lunch break was almost over by the time I got back to work. I get that they get busy, but to not acknowledge a customer who walks into the pickup line after they've already paid or to not answer the phone when a customer calls, is bad customer service. To not have a cancel order button on the website and a way to reach the restaurant is bad web design. The whole situation was frustrating and the food wasn't worth it.","DateTime":1512152002000,"Time_Only":"18:13:22","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"18","Date_Minute":"13"}

I'm pretty comfortable on my own but there are some restaurants that are better than others for dining solo.  \n\nI grew up going to (and loving) Giacomo's.  With that said, I can't imagine going to boisterous, busy, quick Giacomo's on my own.  So I turned to my fellow Yelpers for some other North End ideas on my solo adventure and decided on Pomodoro.\n\nAs I walked from Boston Commons, I figured I'd keep my options open and might stumble upon another spot.  I initially walked by Pomodoro, actually -- I'm not sure it's even labeled (the old restaurant name still shows in the window).  But I found it and stepped in.\n\nThe atmosphere was intimate and cozy with several couples enjoying a romantic meal on a Thursday night.  I was grateful for the empty window seat and asked to sit there.  I'm not a fan of solo diners being forced to sit at a bar, but a window seat is a whole different creature.  And this one?  The bar stool was covered with soft fluffiness and I noticed right away that heat was coming up from the floor heating me in the cold night (okay, it was 40 degrees, but I'm a Southerner now!).  And the people-watching on Hanover is spectacular.\n\nThe menu is somewhat small, but offers enough options for anyone.  There were three red wine options by the glass and I decided upon one from Montepulciano and the Wild Mushroom Ragu Pappardelle.  The waitress brought me the wine and two perfectly-baked warm rolls and some olives in olive oil.  I was already in Heaven. \n\nA few minutes later, she came back with a salad, \"Compliments of the kitchen\".  I know better than to decline a gift or ask questions and the salad was perfectly-dressed.  And what a nice gesture from the restaurant.\n\nI had eaten just over one of the rolls when my entree arrived and the waitress offered me more rolls.  I thought she'd sized me up and decided I could polish off a ton of rolls (true, true) but the reality is the ragu just begs to be mopped up with bread.  With that said, I was already getting full pre-pasta, so I declined the additional rolls.  The ragu was creamier than I'd expected, but not overly heavy and was balanced out with some bitter greens.  I've made pappardelle myself before and this was beautifully rustic and fresh.    It was so good that for a full 10 minutes I forgot that as a solo diner I was supposed to be reading or playing with my phone and just...ate.  I ate all the pasta and felt terribly guilty leaving a few tablespoons of the sauce.  But I was full and planned to swing by Mike's Pastry after.\n\nAfter the waitress took my plate, she brought over a small piece of tiramisu.  Wow.  Another comped item?  We all know that the dessert stomach is separate from the main stomach, so I managed to consume the boozy, sweet, creamy tiramisu.  \n\nAfter asking if I would like more wine, and me declining, she brought the wine bottle over and insisted on \"Just a splash more before you go out into the cold\".  She didn't bring me my check until I waved for it, letting me relax in the cozy nook.\n\nI don't want to lead anyone on by suggesting you'll get freebies.  I think it's likely that my waitress recognized a lone foodie traveler and wanted to brighten my night.  With that said, from the second I walked in the door, I felt love radiating from the restaurant.  By the time I left, I felt like I'd been nurtured for an hour and felt lighter walking back out in the world.  That's a huge gift for Pomodoro to have given me.\n\nCost of this?  $35 pre-tip.  Considering that it felt like a massage and therapy session all rolled into one, I'd say that's a pretty huge bargain.  I would have been satisfied to have paid $35 for just the wine and pasta.\n\nSO glad I decided to swing into this new-to-me spot.  It certainly won't be the last time.","DateTime":1512152072000,"Time_Only":"18:14:32","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"18","Date_Minute":"14"}

And a gentleman and all around good guy. I went through the KBB Instant Cash Offer form online to sell my 2007 Ford F250 Lariat to any interested dealership. Shaun was the first to respond. He contacted me via text message, and I instantly knew I'd like him. In his text, he was friendly, well spoken, forthright, enthusiastic and efficient. As well, he told me it was possible, based on the condition of the truck and how accurately I filled out the form at KBB.com, that Tonkin could offer me MORE than KBB's Instant Cash Offer. Now he really had me listening! We set up an appointment for the next morning so he could, as he promised, inspect my truck, print off a Carfax report for me to keep, and make me a cash offer -- all within 30, yes 30, minutes. \n\nI showed up for the appointment about 15 minutes early, but that didn't throw Shaun off at all. He got right to it - he introduced himself, shook my hand, took the keys and went outside to inspect the truck. There was some damage to one of the running boards, which I had truly forgotten to disclose on the form, but he didn't beat me up for it. It did reduce the Instant Cash Offer, but after a bit of light negotiation, and his making one quick phone call, we settled on a price that was actually $750 MORE than the KBB Instant Cash Offer! Keep in mind that despite the damage to the running board, my truck was in excellent shape all around, interior, exterior and mechanically. And he recognized and acknowledged that it was a very nice truck -- \"no bout adoubt it!\" he said. Ha! Signing the paperwork was easygoing, too. The entire transaction took less than one hour! \n\nAnd here's the icing on the cake: How was I to get home, now that I had sold the vehicle I drove to the appointment? I grumbled about being a cheapskate and not wanting to pay for an Uber ride but that I had no other choice. He whipped out his phone, hailed me an Uber ride, and in three minutes I was on my way home. Did the cheapskate have to pay? No, he did not -- Shaun charged the ride to Tonkin (a little over $30) as a courtesy to me! I was floored and very grateful. \n\nIt's so easy to be cynical toward car dealerships, salespeople, the entire industry. We've all had bad experiences. But my faith is restored, thanks to Shaun, and I can highly recommend your giving Shaun and the Tonkin Buy Center a try when you are ready to sell your vehicle.","DateTime":1512152075000,"Time_Only":"18:14:35","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"18","Date_Minute":"14"}

It makes me sad as well to see this place empty at times. Are people really going to yucky chipotle over this gem? This is as close to home cooking as it gets. It authentic and genuine. I get the carnitas, because damn it's good. They make a ridiculously good carnitas. Tender and perfectly seasoned. The pinto beans are always cooked thru to perfection, soft yet firm, never dry. The rice is perfectly seasoned. Never salty and always fluffy, firm yet tender. The homemade sauce ( the green one) is out of this world. It's mild with a good amount of flavor. Even the extra spicy is good if you are looking for a kick. Overall the fam that works there are the sweetest people ever. Always have a smile accomadating and never any attitude. They are fantastic. My only gripe, and legit my only, and I didn't take away stars for it, but I feel like it needs to made aware because another yelper mentioned it. The white dude (hate saying that but it's the only way to identify or rectify the situation) will give major attitude. We had words over the fact of me ordering extra sauce. He asked if I would like everything on my plate. I told him my specifics and said I will take extra sauce. As well he was prepping my food. I got a different, very spicy sauce, so I asked if they changed the sauce. He replied no you asked for extra sauce. Mind you, I have been coming to this establishment for at least 5 years I would say. During which time I was not aware that there was an EXTRA HOT sauce. Good to know. Then he reprimanded me and told me to not assume. Hmmm am I tho? Otherwise, help comes and goes and this was only recent and I don't hold it against the establishment, theres no reason, but it should be made aware that his lack of customer service could potentially reflect badly on the establishment.If you are expecting fake taco bell food, then yes you will be dissapointed.

I was a bit flustered because I did not know what I was doing, so I just grabbed a box and stuffed my item in there and went to the counter to checkout & make sure that what I was doing was correct. While I waited, I noticed the women seemed nice to other people so I felt some relief. Well, I was wrong. I was still flustered and I was like I'm not sure if this is right and she was like no, you need a box from over there...okay? To me, the boxes look the same. She also went on to tell me I needed tape to attach the label. Apparently postal workers are stingy about tape, but I still grabbed some. She then just there. I had no idea what to do and she became agitated and rude (I wasn't doing anything wrong, I was just confused about what to do and it would have taken less time for her to be nice instead of making me feel ashamed). I walked out because I was in tears at that point because she was making me anxious. I still had the tape in my hand (literally on the verge of a panic attack, I don't need your tape so relax) and I put it down and had to run out while having a full blown panic attack.\n\nI got into the car and I was sobbing. After explaining the situation, I asked my friend to go take care of the package for me because I was not going back in there nor would I ever return. She went in and was met with glares, even another customer was snickering at her because they knew she was with me. Kayla, the employee, continued to be disrespectful and rude.  For some reason, she decided to flip the script and told my friend it was the right box & she could use their tape. She continued to be ignorant and huff & puff.\n\nUSPS employees have a culture of being unhelpful and ignorant which is very sad. I read some other google reviews about this USPS store and it sounds like many people have had similar issues with a female employee (likely Kayla, if that's even her real name).  She shamed and embarrassed me. If you do not like working with people who may not know everything, don't do anything involving customer service - it's that simple.

Despite the warning, we still managed to order two rather large draft beers.\n\nA comfortable 10-15 minute wait later, our appies started to come in - deep fried pickles, cornbread with cinnamon honey butter and hush puppies. \n\nThe deep fried pickles were interesting for sure - dill pickles (that you typically get with a sandwich) lightly battered and fried. It came with a chipotle aoli. I think the flavour of the dill pickles themselves pretty overwhelmed all the other flavours for me, but the batter was very light and crispy. Large portion (we got like 5).\n\nThe cornbread and hush puppies came together. I love corn bread, but this one was just too dry. The butter helped a bit, but it still didn't really quite save it.

They all had a smoky flavour to it, but if I were to be honest, they all kind of started to taste the same. I do recall some pieces of meat were a bit dry (probably the brisket).. but the homemade BBQ sauce helped. The chicken was more moist. The pulled pork was ok.

The staff are nice enough but the service is altogether very slow. It took us a while to get greeted and seated, to put in our order, and to get refills on water. We did come at around 2pm so maybe they were off there game (there was no wait though).\n\n-LUNCH HOT POT SET: We chose the half and half broth, and it was great to have both! The spiciness of the red one was a little too much for us so we took out most of the peppers so it didn't make the broth spicier. The bone marrow side was really tasty with the perfect amount of saltiness. We chose lamb for our meat, which I'm not sure was frozen enough for us to dip. It fell apart really easy so we weren't able to swish the meat like we like. Though the garlic in the bone marrow broth is amazingly soft.\n-LAMB SKEWERS: Not the cumin flavor I was expecting but it was okay.\n-MEAT PIE: Expensive for what you get. It's very small and thin. \n-SAUCES: They did say we probably wouldn't need the sauces but I usually like it at hot pot places. However, these sauces were terrible (we just didn't take the warning). We got the garlic and sesame sauces. And don't get me wrong, we absolutely love garlic, but the garlic sauce had a raw taste. The sesame sauce was more a creamy sesame sauce that was kinda strange to use. \n\nI really wanted to like this place but my experience here was very mediocre.

The first visit was the soft opening. I had the Corned Beef and Cabbage. Five stars awesome. A few days later I returned for Fish and Chips. Very good, if not a little greasy. Attributed that to being their second day open and still working out the kinks. Next visit was Sheppards Pie. Delicious and substantial. \n\nToday I had the Corned Beef and Cabbage again. Not the the three slabs I received on the soft opening... I received about 3 ounces of meat that had been pulled apart. My buddy's order looked smaller than mine. The Corned Beef was a little overdone, but I don't mind a little crispiness so much. Tasted fine. But for $14, I didnt get the value I expect.\n\nMy first visit they served too much. This time was not enough. I hope they get this right, cause I like the place... But much like your neighbor (Tiger+Lily) you have to get the value proposition right. Set standards for the amount of food delivered. And if you did, and this is the new standard, then change it. You don't want customers feeling like they didn't get what they paid for...\n\nUpdate: February 2018\nI keep going back, hoping they hit their stride. I got the Mahone Rueben this time. Essentially this is corned beef, cabbage (instead of saurkraut) and dressing. After my last visit I tracked down the owner to ask if they reduced their portion size. He said they had, since people were leaving meat on the plate. I get it, but that is penalizing your more robust (and likely enthusiastic) eaters because some people are better at moderating. The owner said when I return I can ask for him and he will have the cook bump up the meat (my buddy called this the fat basterd option). Unfortunately, I don't like to hunt down the owner anytime I visit. I did relate this story to the server on my most recent visit and asked for the fat basterd option . I suspect I received the normal allotment of corned beef, because it was meager.  I ordered a side of Cole slaw which arrived in the typical small bowl. \n\nSo, the Reuben concept was decent but not preferable to the standard version. The meat was much less than you will get at any respectable deli. And the cost... My Reuben and cole slaw cost me $13 on the tab with no drink, $16 with tip. Sorry guys, but the quality and the quantity fall short. I doubt I will return.","DateTime":1512153764000,"Time_Only":"18:42:44","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"18","Date_Minute":"42"}

The food came out and the tempeh chill was great, then I started the eat the salad. The hummus on the salad was so disgusting it tasted like it had gone rotten. I have never had this experience as I have always enjoyed their hummus. I went up to the counter to let them know immediately and the girl said they wound re do it with a fresh batch of hummus they just made.

Now, I understand things happen and the hummus being off was something they could fix and not a big deal. It was the attitude of the people working there that really bothers me the most. When the other lady spoke up about her hummus being off also, instead of apologizing the girl behind the counter got visibly annoyed by her comment and it seemed like it was a bother more than anything . I then waited for the new 'remade' plate to come out, the guy came out of the kitchen and plopped it down on my table without a word. I tased the hummus and again it was still really bad. I took it up to the girl , and told her I would just prefer to have my money back at this point. She then brought out a new small sample and said, here is the new batch they just made...you could try this one. Ummmm, wasn't my remade one supposed to already have the new batch this time? That was upsetting to know they just remade it with the same exact hummus as the first time so I just said please refund me the money. Her and the other girl seemed if anything annoyed and not sorry about this happening or that I may risk becoming sick from eating bad hummus. I am not a picky person and would never have said anything unless it was that bad. That being said, the customer service seemed very entitled and just uncaring overall about this happening. I don't mind paying over $20 for a salad and small chili, but I would expect the food to be high quality and most of all that the staff caring about the experience the customer is having.

It's located across the street from ChaTime and Beard Papa. I arrived around 6:15 PM and it was pretty bustling. Gong Cha is a small, cozy space with just one bench that seats a few people. There isn't much room to stand! \n\nI ordered one of their specialties\u200b, the Milk Foam Green Tea ($3.75 for a medium- their starting size). The service was quick and efficient. The cashier will ask you what kind of toppings you'd like and your preferred sugar level for the drink. I requested no toppings and a sugar level of 70%. I got my drink in about four minutes or so! There was a line steadily forming by the time I was done placing my order. \n\nI didn't have my drink until I got home, so all the layers were mixed together! Luckily, the foam was still distinguishable when I sipped. It was lightly salted, which was something so new to me! The tea itself was sweet, so the salty\/sweet combination really worked for me. The green tea flavor was subtle but definitely prominent. The foam layer made everything taste so creamy and decadent! I let my mom try some and she was surprised\u200b by how good it was (she's not really a big fan of sweets). The 70% sugar level was just right.\n\nGong Cha's menu is quite expansive. I'm excited to give some other drinks a try! :- )","DateTime":1512154151000,"Time_Only":"18:49:11","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"18","Date_Minute":"49"}

It took about 10 minutes to get a table because it was so busy, but the staff were on it cleaning us a table and promptly serving. They have specials every night, drink and food. Thursday night with \"50% more wine\" night! Worked for me! I got a 9 ounce glass for the price of a 6. Which is great because this is not an inexpensive pub. A 6 ounce glass runs over $10. Most menu items seem to be $15-$30. My four stars is for the service. This was the best service I have had at a pub in a long time. Our server was on it and frequently checked in for drinks.

My 8 year old son was recently injured and we had 4 staff people attend to his crying when he was waiting to be seen - complete with TLC and chocolate, kind words, propping of pillows so he could be comfy in the waiting room and the MOST patient and kind treatment from Pablo and Dr. Singh to fix his neck injury. They put him at ease and really helped him feel better. My boy emerged from the appointment with greater mobility and asking if he could come back again the next day! Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this place. It is a gem in our community and the people who work there really care about helping others heal and feel their best.","DateTime":1512154905000,"Time_Only":"19:01:45","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"1"}

They make a nice brisket here.\" -- L.A. Law: Season 1 | Episode 20\n\nI have found brisket heaven and it's called 4 Rivers Smokehouse. Please deliver me moist brisket weekly and there won't be any trouble. \n\nMy first visit was thanks to the Yelp event earlier in the year - I didn't event, but I saw photos and heard raves - they were the big hit of the day. I have since been back a couple of times, mostly thanks to Malika and John. I stepped into the joint the first time and my friend was last (waling from the Marta stop) and I was just standing around. Malika and John kept offering to help me and I said I would wait. Then I had a couple of samples... \n\nYes, they will let you try things (as long as it is not a boned meat) to help you decide what you want to order. Don't abuse the system. This helped me a great deal and damn - this is ingenious. It really ropes you in and is wonderful customer service. Malika was really the \"pusher\" of their dishes and helped advise me on both what to order (I wanted 3 or 4 meats) and on sides - interviewing me on my likes and dislikes. Give that girl a RAISE!\n\nTop meat? The brisket. You can get it moist or dry (this is the amount of fat in the meat). Next, the trip tip - pick your level of doneness. Perfectly seasoned, smokey and juicy. Smoked Turkey - thanksgiving takes a turn on the smoker - also perfectly juicy and lovely peppery skin. Pulled pork - any piggy lovers dream - get the sauce.\n\nAs for sides - I love the corn and the fried okra. Those are my top two for sure. The grit cake is also a winner in my book. I enjoyed the biscuit more than the cornbread, but I am a Southern girl who needs biscuits for energy.\n\nThe downstairs of this restaurant is on the smaller side - they have seating outside as well and then upstairs is supposed to be for take-out. I have not been upstairs as all of my visits have been for dine-in. The parking lot is located behind the restaurant and the signs to turn in are marked for the diner next door - but it is a shared lot, it just is not obvious when you are driving up.\n\nI'm in love with a slab of beef slow smoked by professionals and I don't mind admitting it.","DateTime":1512155197000,"Time_Only":"19:06:37","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"6"}

The general experience, apart from the food, was very pleasant. And, despite the problems, we plan to give Zucca another try in the near future (hoping that the problems will have been fixed by then).\n\nBut. The food. With only one exception, everything we tried completely missed the mark. The calamari was perfectly fried, but the breading was inedibly salty. And the accompanying pepperoncini sauce\/relish was very astringent, and didn't complement the calamari at all. The foccacia wasn't like any foccacia we've ever had before, extremely dense and dry. The suppli weren't heated through, so the little cheese cubes within were unmelted. The sausage pizza was unusually bland. The shrimp scampi weren't shrimp scampi. The dish consisted of overly-broiled shrimp, served with an oddly thick and chunky sauce (mostly almonds?) that, flavor-wise, actively worked against the shrimp. The slider buns were so hard and dry that a serrated knife literally couldn't cut though them. Nor could hungry teeth bite through them. The only decent thing we had was the tiramisu, which Callie offered us as a comp for those inedible sliders. (Except for the dessert, we paid for everything.)\n\nSounds like we would never return, doesn't it?

The regular salad portions are ginormous, and unless you're a professional rabbit, a half-sized \"Half-Snap\" is all you'll really need. \n\nIt's apparently a popular chain out of Dallas, Westlake is their first Austin location, and they're sharing that former La Madeleine space with a soon-to-be Zoe's Kitchen. Cool. I should disclose I'm not the biggest fan of communal table seating, and Snappy isn't exactly what I'd call cheap. But I see what they're going for, and just go with the axiom \"You get what you pay for.\" Be sure to download & take advantage of their rewards app before arriving.

It's located in the former Doc Green's restaurant, next to Smoothie King.\n\nI like how homey the place felt but it was still casual and same set up as Doc Green's from what I remembered. \n\nYes, yes.

I was confused with my order cause I really thought I would get a side of fries and not just a few fries for decoration. Although my salad was huge, I'm picky, didn't care for the olives or tomatoes. I don't mind tomatoes in gyro but I cannot do tomatoes by itself, well raw ones that is. I did say no feta cheese too.\n\nThe lady was really nice and she noticed my confusion and said she'll bring fries out, on the house. What??? That is awesome, huh?\n\nFalafel gyro is delicious!!! I usually get only 3 falafels in gyro or wraps but this one had 4 or maybe 5? I just know that one of my falafel fell out haha.\n\nService is top notch. Food is delicious. Interior is cute.

Fries were still the same great fries with a small hint of parmesan and little to no garlic flavor at all. I felt so betrayed. It feels like instead of salt they just sprinkle it with parmesan and garlic flavoring powder (like for popcorn) minus the garlic flavor. Definitely could do better if you just got a large fries, unsalted, and brought your own parmesan garlic seasoning.

Don't forget to Prost! \n\nGood for groups and out of towners beerhalls are always lively and fun and a pretty safe bet for friends to enjoy camaraderie. Jacob Wirth definitely has all of that.","DateTime":1512156160000,"Time_Only":"19:22:40","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"22"}

I was informed they didn't have 33 white roses but they could mix the red and the white roses together. \n\nWhen my Mother received the flowers, she counted and realized there were only 23.  I called and was told I could either have someone come out and deliver 10 more roses or they could give me my money back for the 10 roses I did not receive and that she could not do anything more until I talked to the Manager who would call me on Monday.   I decided to take the option of getting my money back for 10 flowers and would wait to talk to the manager next week.  I even called back to see if I could get all of the money back later on in the day and she confirmed that I would have to wait to talk to the manager. \n\nOn Friday of the following week, I ended up calling the shop because I had not heard from the owner.  They said he tried calling me and would give me a call back in a few minutes.  The owner calls me and is rude from the start.  He tells me he tried calling on Monday and my voicemail was full so he left it at that.  They had my e-mail address so I would think they would e-mail to inform me they reached.  Either way, I thought the way he started the phone call was rather rude but I thanked him for letting me know that my mailbox was full and proceeded to discuss the situation. \n\nI am calm throughout the call and told him I understood he would not give me all of my money back but asked if he could charge me for 1 dozen instead of 23 since I ordered 33 to begin with as I don't think its fair to pay full price for their mistake.  He told me he couldn't do that and that I already chose the option to receive the money back for the 10 roses they did not deliver.  \n\nI work in the service industry as well and respect customer sentiment so I am not quite sure why the owner of all people would argue with me when I am not even asking for all of my money back. \n\nIt gets worse.  After asking him about the option for a dozen roses and asking what he could do to make this write and him informing me that there was nothing else he could do, he tells me he is ending the call because I am not listening to him.  I asked him what he was offering and that I don't think its fair for him to tell me that I had two options and I chose the one given to me by the staff on duty at that time when they said I would have the opportunity to talk with the owner Monday.  \n\nAt the end of the day, he is the owner and has the final call.  I found it rude to have to pay for 23 roses when I ordered 33.  I also found it rude that he would not honor my request to pay for a dozen roses instead of the 23 roses I did not order.  But what blew me away was that he hung up the phone when I asked him to confirm that he wasn't giving me any more of my money back and said I wasn't listening to him.  In all reality, I wasn't just agreeing with what he wanted me to do and that seemed to be the source of the problem.\n\nWe were visiting the area from out of town with a large group and were so thrilled to have these flowers for our Mom even though we were only going to have the flowers for one day. \n\nI strongly urge anyone in the area to choose another flower shop.  I was willing to work with them and leave them a positive review even after this mishap.  But I am coming out of retirement of writing reviews for businesses specifically  for Flower Power and the rude chauvinistic treatment I just received from the owner.","DateTime":1512156662000,"Time_Only":"19:31:02","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"31"}

I transferred my Renter's insurance long before moving in, but noted I'd been charged for \"lack of insurance coverage\" in my rent.  I called Geico and they said NO ONE from EOS ever called to verify coverage.  So, I emailed my policy to Jason in the front office, and was told I was charged due to NON-Compliance!!!  Get this....\nFogelman Management, in MEMPHIS, has to be the address listed on your coverage, NOT the ACTUAL APT address!!  Jason states my daughter received a letter to this effect, but she said she never saw it.  WHY ISN'T THIS TOLD TO YOU WHEN YOU SIGN THE LEASE?????   I'll tell you why....I'm positive this is to collect an extra $20 per month per resident until the Memphis address is added.  It's EXTORTION plain and simple!!  Oh, and Jason says it's not his job to contact residents to let them know this, nor is it his job to contact insurance providers to verify coverage.  Thanks EOS!!!!  Your true fluff is showing!!!\n\nI just recently moved from Melbourne (Brevard County) to Orlando.  Since losing my drivers license due to a medical condition, I opted to move into EOS.  \nThe location is superb and I can easily walk to Publix, Jet's Pizza, Lee's Nail Salon, and many other businesses.  Wawa is close as well, in case Publix is closed. \nHowever, there is a hefty price for this convenience.  I opted for a 10 month lease and pay $1650 a month for a small two bedroom\/two bath.  This is far too much for any apartment and is a price normally suited to a golf course condo or rent for a private home.\nLiving on the ground floor poses problems with noise.  My bedroom is adjacent to the elevators and it's VERY noisy!!  I'm just getting used to sleeping thru most of it.  Car alarms and revving car engines pose a threat to sleep here too.\nI doubt I will renew my lease here when the time comes unless the rental fee's become more reasonable.  \nEOS's location is its greatest asset and all the rest is fluff.  However, the prices are far too hefty for most middle class folks.","DateTime":1512156888000,"Time_Only":"19:34:48","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"34"}

As I said and never concealed, I did contact you on August 16, 2016 regarding my doctor's concern of the Zika virus in Costa Rica as I was 9 weeks pregnant at the time. I provided you with a doctor's note stating he did not want me to travel to the region and pursuant to the email you posted, I asked you what do I need to do for a refund. I never requested a cancellation. You replied that you will not provide me with a refund, as you posted. You also provided me with a copy of your \"Policy.\" Again, I never requested a cancellation, I was asking you what is your process for a refund. One week later, on August 23, 2016, YOU cancelled the Costa Rica Trip due to the same Zika concern.

To date, I have not received a refund. To date, the other numerous trippers have not received a refund. \n\nSecondly, I never said I did not contact an attorney. After numerous attempts to contact you to resolve this matter with no response, I was forced to consult with an attorney. You never bothered responding to my attorney either. Thank you for confirming receipt of his correspondence per your post. \n\nFurthermore, the Consumer Protection Division in Atlanta, Georgia sent me a letter stating they were unsuccessful in obtaining a response from you. I am not sure why you are saying you addressed anything with them. As you have a history of not addressing issues, I find it hard to believe you addressed anything with the Consumer Protection Division.  \n\nYour response neither resolves this matter nor paints you in the best light. You cancelled the trip and promised a refund. To date, you have not provided me or any of the other trippers a refund. \n\nI will be posting all the emails I referenced above. Again I say, anyone thinking of doing business with Just Trippin' Travelers Club - DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!! YOU WILL REGRET IT.","DateTime":1512157099000,"Time_Only":"19:38:19","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"38"}

This time when my therapist picked me up she took me into the treatment room then looked down at my stomach and ASKED ME IF I WAS PREGNANT which I was not!!!! It was mortifying and embarrassing and I burst into tears. The women working the front desk was trying to apologize then said the therapists always ask people that before they start a service which is not true because I had been there half a dozen times and no one had ever asked me that. I work in the industry and if you don't know by now that this is offensive and inappropriate you need some lessons in professionalism.

I'll speak to the food in a minute--for now, I must agree with other reviewers however; the prices are too high for many items.  (The ceviche is crazy fresh however and I don't feel it was out of line compared to our sushi bars.....)\n\nThe alcohol is going to cause the place issues.   I liked my wine and we had an Old Fashioned drinker who was quite happy.  But their menu is tailored to a Peruvian niche and frankly, the beer drinkers at our table were not amused.  Not only is the beer menu odd, but they were out of almost all beers!  Quit trying to be so Peruvian that folks can't drink beer here. Seriously!  This is such a big deal to us,  I subtracted an entire star from the review. Based on the food, I would have offered 4  =(\n\nSo the food.  There were several of us, and we tried quite a few dishes. I'll tell you about each, below.\n\n* Chifles (plantain chips \/ blue potato chips \/ aj\u00ed amarillo salsa)  -- a great starter for $ 5.  The salsa is magnificent, even if they were a bit stingy with it.  5 stars\n*  Cebiche Mixto* (drum \/ octopus \/ shrimp \/ leche de tigre \/  aj\u00ed limo \/ yuyo \/ micro cilantro)  --- out of this world, and I believe a bargain at $15.  Much more (super) fresh fish than Mongers will give you, and it tasted better with loads of bright acidity and fresh seaweed.    5 stars \n*  Pastel de Choclo  (andean corn pur\u00e9e \/ sofrito beef \/ casserole)  --biggest hit of the night, suggested by our awesome waiter, Ross.  This is like a comforting pot pie, Peruvian style.  GET IT!  5 exuberant stars.\n*  Pulpo al Olivo  (octopus \/ botija olive aioli \/ yuyo \/ purple potatoes \/ micro greens)  -- maybe I just prefer my pulpo grilled.  This wasn't as tasty, but it was fresh (even if not plentiful for the $14 price tag.)  I would not order again.   3 stars\n*  Causa Nacional (chilled potato pur\u00e9e \/ pulled chicken filling \/ aj\u00ed amarillo and botija olive aioli) --  a cold appetizer that I didn't care for, nor did 2 of the 4 others.  If you have a meat\/taters kind of person, this might be their bag.   2 stars\n* Pork Bao Buns (hoisin pork belly \/ cabbage slaw \/ ginger aioli) -- ok if a bit sweet, but the price tag of $6 is for one bun.  WAY overpriced --stay away.  1 star\n*  Wow Cacao  (dark chocolate cake \/ dulce de leche \/ maracuy\u00e1 ice cream)  -- nice serving portion and the cake was good, just not great.  The ice cream (passionfruit) was out of this world however, so it gets a slightly higher average.  4 stars\n\nIt's a great place, with plenty of free parking. But the alchohol list needs to be expanded and supply issues need to be worked out.  Right now, the prices are on par with odd duck.  The food is not quite there.  So, something's gotta give.....","DateTime":1512157283000,"Time_Only":"19:41:23","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"41"}

When we told the employees what was wrong about our order, they sprinkled some seasoning on our fries on the tray in front of me and put the wings that had the wrong sauce back into the fryer...they could've apologized and tossed the fries properly and gave us fresher wings, they had about 3 baskets of wings sitting up cooked already.\nAlso, the staff wasn't wearing gloves. The woman that was taking the orders was going back and forth with helping the kitchen staff and handling money...those are big red flags for food safety. \nWe asked for a refund and went somewhere else for lunch.

However, they we're ultimately unable to help beyond having the manager give us a call, who at the end of the day was incredibly unhelpful.\n\nHonestly we never take the time to write reviews, but our experience was so frustrating here, we thought we'd take the time to warn others of this business and the terrible ethics they demonstrated to us. \n\nTo make a long story short, we brought in a few items to get cleaned before making a move out of state. We were told that the price to clean one of our rugs would be between $35 and $55 dollars, and that we should expect it finished within 4-7 business days. After almost 2 weeks of waiting we gave them a call to see where our rug was as we were moving in 1 week and needed to get things packed. We were told that it was sent off to a 3rd party cleaner but should be arriving any day. \n\nThe day before we moved out of state, we called them and were told that the rug would now cost $175, and that it was still not ready for us to pick up. To make things even more interesting, they expected for us to pay for shipping the rug to Colorado, which they estimated would cost another $50 - $75.  Suddenly a $35 - $55 quote was now being turned into a $200 - $250 invoice. If we would have known the rug would take over 3 weeks to get back to us, we would have never dropped it off in the first place, not to mention we were now being expected to pay 3x what they had originally quoted us?  \n\nWe received a phone call from the manager, Diana, and after a few exchanges we got them to agree to charge us the original quote of $55 for the rug ... however they still expected us to pay for shipping the rug up to Colorado which we were not going to do. So...our rug was being held hostage, it felt like extortion, we had no leverage to get our rug sent to us without having to pay upwards of $75 to ship it even though it was completely on them for giving us the wrong timeframe for receiving our rug ... by over 3 weeks. \n\nAfter several voicemails trying to get Diana to call us back to work this out, we decide to have a family member in Texas pick it up for us, knowing that one day we'd eventually be back in Texas and could pick up our rug then. Getting the rug out of this establishment was better than just letting it sit there. \n\nOverall it was some of the worst customer service we've ever experienced and such a waste of our time calling back and forth trying to figure out what was going on; honestly we couldn't recommend this business any less.","DateTime":1512158281000,"Time_Only":"19:58:01","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"19","Date_Minute":"58"}

While they don't have the rolled ice cream or poke options, Viiza focuses on bubble tea and the pizza cone snacks. Their menu shows some tasty looking options, but I ended up ordering just one cone, the Spicy cone. It was pretty tasty, but not sure how I felt hearing it come out of the toaster oven the way it did. At least it wasn't a microwave... or was it? I can't deny that it was a tasty snack, though. \n\nViiza also picked up on the new trend of lightbulb teas. I personally would have preferred to save $1 on my drink and get it in a regular plastic cup, but I partook in the trend and got a honey green tea. It was tasty but nothing special. \n\nOverall, Viiza would be a good snack option if you can't make the trek out to Buford Highway.

They gave us a buzzer that would go off when our food was ready, which fortunately didn't' take long. \n\nFirst off, I'm a huge fan of the Bacon Cheese Fries! They were delicious and the cheese they use reminds of that awesome cheese that comes out of the nacho machine. I also really liked my Double Smoke Shack burger which had cherry peppers and bacon.\n\nThe only cons were that I felt like it was a bit expensive, I paid about $16 for my burger and fries, and I wished their burgers had more vegetables in them. As far as chain hamburger places go, Shake Shack seems more upscale and clean.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of Shake Shack and will probably try this place again.","DateTime":1512160230000,"Time_Only":"20:30:30","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"20","Date_Minute":"30"}

A friend of mine was celebrating her birthday, and choose Poor Calvin's as the location. I was really excited to dine here. They did NOT disappoint. I'm currently eating my leftovers, but more on that later. From the moment we walked in, this place felt very cozy and comforting...almost like you were walking into the neighborhood bar that you've been going to for years. We were the largest party, so we were sat front and center in the restaurant. Here is where things get REALLY good. Our server was \"Lola\", and you couldn't write a script for a better character than what she is in REAL LIFE. Poor Calvin's needs to hold on to Lola forever, because she is making the dining experience THAT MUCH BETTER. She was not only very welcoming and FUNNY, but she was very well versed on the menu. Per her suggestion, my table had a variety of appetizers including Lobster Wontons topped with caviar, Lobster Mac N Cheese, Corn Dip, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Frog Legs. Nothing was bad...EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS....I was very skeptical about the caviar, but it was AMAZING with the Lobster Wontons. The corn dip was especially delicious. The Chef's Special yesterday was Trout served with Risotto and a Lobster Fritter. It was DIVINE! The cocktail menu is also very good. While I didn't partake, my friends raved about them, especially the Hennessey with grapes and brown sugar (the name escapes me). Needless to say, Poor Calvin's WILL be a staple on my restaurant Go-To list. I'm already planning a Brunch outing....I hear the Crab Meat Grilled Cheese sandwich is heaven on earth!!!!! Definitely make a reservation! This place is popular, but not big AT ALL. There could easily be a wait. Also, parking is not great, but such is life in this city.

She quelled all of my concerns and fears and when I walked through the door, she did all of my pre-testing and made me feel comfortable.  Dr. Novak was amazing and answered all of my questions and had so much patience with me.  She explained the disease  fully to me, and gave me much more information than I previously received.  I was not in need of $8,000 of uncovered services immediately, as I had been told at the other doctor.  I picked out very cute glasses and got all of my options from Callie, including learning about magnetic sunglass clip-ons, which, again, was never an option for me anywhere else.

At first I wasn't too jazzed about visiting the aquarium because I often find them to be sad as the animals usually seem bummed to be there. This was not the case at the Vancouver Aquarium, since many of the animals are rescued. \n\nHighlights:\n-Jellyfish are mesmerizing: If I had an unlimited budget to spend on my house, I'd for sure have a giant wall sized tank of beautiful jellyfish. \n-Jellyfish light display: We are all about the jelly here! And near the jellyfish wall there's a fun light display in the ceiling that has a board nearby where you run your finger on it and the jellyfish light up. My kids really got a kick out of it. Heck, I had a blast playing with it!\n-Otters: I never thought I'd love an otter but now I'm a huge fan! They have an outdoor habitat for the otters and it's so much fun to watch them play in the water. My daughters could literally stand there all day and watch them otter around. If you miss them there's also an otter cam that you can find online on the aquarium's website!\n-Educational talks: You might roll your eyes at this, but I found all the talks to be very interesting and more importantly, my kids were enthralled as well. Now that's how you know you're onto something!\n-Discover Rays: A hands on experience where you get to actually touch rays in a giant pool of water. \n\nIt was pretty rainy on the day of our visit but we still enjoyed ourselves! It would have been even better if the weather had been more cooperative, but that's the breaks folks.

There was clearly a new guy at the counter with another gentleman who I recognized always being in charge of the delicatessen side of the restaurant.

The older gentlemen training the new guy was really trying to teach the process of things to this employee. It shows me that the mid-upper management really wants this place the be successful with merit.\n\nSecond observation was actually an experience I had there some time back. I went there to get breakfast with my wife and it was really busy. There was a little bit of a wait to get seated but I could tell the restaurant was serving its food at a good pace and with a calm waitstaff. We sat after 10 minutes or so after being quoted a 30 minute wait. Very nice. Our table where we were seated let me view their open kitchen. While enjoying bloody Mary's i watched a badass kitchen crew slug their way threw a Saturday brunch service. I could see a experienced female chef take briskets and what not out of what I believe to be a C-Vap tray and just slice after slice after slice with her knife. My arm started hurting just watching but it clearly shows a strength in stamina and commitment to quality of product to sacrifice comfort levels like that.

I got a Brazilian, Brow Wax + Shape and Lash Lift + Tint. So spent a pretty penny my first visit to the salon.\n\nPositives: The salon is very nice, and my girl was very sweet and made me very comfortable - and I gave her a great tip just for spending about 2 hours on all my services. \n\nNegatives: There is a lack of attention to detail. I left feeling a little lackluster and not properly \"groomed.\" I recommend coming here if you you are not particular about the quality of the service.\n\nRecap on Services:\nFor a Brazilian, it's suppose to be all or nothing - kind of hard to mess that up. The application of the wax was a bit messy and she took it off in small strips - like waxing eyebrows. My pain tolerance is high, but this would be agonizing for someone else. When my wax was complete I had still had a good amount of hair left inside the lady cave - imagine \"The Lorax\" from Dr Seuss. I went to another salon to have the rest of it taken completely off the next day, and was laughed at by the other wax lady. Embarrassment + paying for 2 Brazilians to get that clean look - not what I planned on doing this week.\n\nFor the Brow-Shaping + Wax, didnt even look like my eyebrows were done. Besides a slight wax to take of some stray hairs and a trim - My eyebrows look exactly the same as the did when I walked in so there as no true shaping. I'm booking to go to another salon to get them done since they don't look recently groomed.\n\nFor the Eyelash Tint + Lift. The tint looks great! However for the lash lift - one eye is perfectly fanned out lashes and the other looks like it had a rough night out. One looks carefully combed and separated, and the other has a cluster lashes bent to one side and grouped together. Beauty is all about symmetry, and this look will last 6-8 weeks so Im just going to have to deal with looking like one eye didn't show up to the party.\n\nI was hoping this salon could be my one stop shop. Brazilian, Lash Extensions, Brows and anything else they offer, but there is a lack of attention to detail that is really needed to feel comfortable coming back here.\n\nI probably should have said something before I left, but between a sore eye and needing to get back to the office, I didn't want to offend anyone and their work.","DateTime":1512162350000,"Time_Only":"21:05:50","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"21","Date_Minute":"5"}

He scribbled some calculations on a piece of paper (that he kept), verbally gave me an estimate that seemed more or less ok to me (maybe a little high), sent me to the paint store where his son works to pick out a color, and told me he'd have someone here in the morning to do the job. He also said he'd have a couple of guys he knows call me about carpet for my stairs and a small handyman job I need done in my laundry area. Matt came and finished in a day, and I was pleased with his work. That's the good part. \n\nAfter Matt left, I phoned Walt to ask him how much I owed him, so I could have my bank send him a check (other contractors have been fine with this in the past; in any case payment was something we discussed beforehand). At this point things got a little weird and unpleasant. He implied I should have written down the amount he'd told me a couple of days earlier and said he'd have to get that number to me. He also said he'd had \"trouble\" with banks sending checks and he wanted me to pay cash. Since it was the end of the day, we agreed to meet the next morning. The next morning I still hadn't received an invoice from him, so I phoned him from the bank to again ask how much I owed him. He gave me a number over the phone and said he was already on his way to my house to pick up the money! He showed up a short time after I got there, still without an invoice. I gave him the cash anyway and requested a statement, which he promised to send (surprise! -- never happened). What tipped me over into writing this review was the insinuating remark he made when I also gave him a thank you card with a tip inside for the painter: he asked me if I'd put my number in there too. WHAAT?!\n\nI gather from other reviewers' comments and my own experience that this contractor runs hot and cold in terms of his professionalism.

When it came out, she started eating her pancakes and saw an inch long white hair. I advised her to send it back, and the server told her 'well I can't see it but okay'. He then returned to the table with the same plate and said 'oh it's a fiber from the raspberries.' I asked my sister to send me a photo and this hair IS LONG AND WHITE. This is clearly not a fiber from a raspberry and if it is, I'd like to know where they are getting them from. My sister did not finish her meal and I told her if she did not feel comfortable talking to the server, to talk to the people in the front taking payment and they would help her out. She spoke to one woman who said 'okay, I'll talk to my manager and get it taken off of your bill.'\n\nThe manager then also told my sister that this was a fiber from the raspberries. It is very clear it is NOT A FIBER from the RASPBERRIES. He was very rude and treated them poorly the entire time they were talking. The thing is, these things happen. It's normal.

A co-worker gave me CPR and called 911.  I regained consciousness at the hospital, but had limited cognitive ability and could not understand what was going on.  I had been working when the seizure occurred and I had approximately $980 in cash in my pocket, which was to be placed in the company vault at the end of my shift.  As I was not conscious at that time, the cash stayed in my pocket until I arrived in my room at the Hospital, at which time staff took the cash and placed it on the table with my Passport.\n\ntwo days later, I awoke to find my Breakfast sitting on the side table, and the cash, which had been there the evening prior, was gone.\n\nI immediately reported it to MGH Police, who took a detailed report, as well as the case manager for th 20th Floor.  I called the head of the 20th floor, the case manager, Patient Advocacy and MGH police repeatedly during my stay to seek resolution, but NEVER received a return call, response or explanation, other than to be passed back ad forth between the various parties involved.\n\nI provided the Floor supervisor and the MGH Police with a copy of my daily log sheet from that day (Sunday the 12th of November)  The log sheet detailed every transaction, cash, credit card, prepaid, and tickets, the total cash matched exactly the amount I was claiming was stolen by the food service staff.  The floor manager indicated that if I could provide this documentation, MGH would issue a reimbursement.  I provided the information and over a week has elapsed with not so much as a return call.\n\nI am now forced to seek reimbursement through the court system.\n\nWhen you are a patient at a Hospital, and have limited cognitive capacity due to a seizure, the last thing you could envision is hospital staff stealing large sums of money from you.  I would have in the past recommended MGH, but no longer.  This matter was handled horribly from the initial lack of concern about an unconscious persons valuables to the general lack of interest in the fact those valuables were eventually stolen, whit the Hospital taking NO ACTION of any kind.\n\nHad I been conscious and aware at the time, I would take responsibility for not asking for my valuables to be safely stored, but that was not the case.  I was at the mercy of criminal employees of MGH.  The person who stole the money cold easily have been identified by MGH Police, there is only one delivery person per floor for each mean service.  I would be surprised if MGH Police even approached this individual.\n\nI will do my best not to be a victim, and I will pursue MGH in court, for potential patients be VERY CAREFUL and make certain you are being protected.\n\nThank you for reading this review\n\nChristopher P.","DateTime":1512163394000,"Time_Only":"21:23:14","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"21","Date_Minute":"23"}

Last night was our last night together. We picked Hobnob because it was close and seemed fun and pretty affordable for us and some other friends we invited to join us. The food was a huge disappointment. A few of us got butternut squash \"lasagna\" that was just a mishmash of ingredients--not layered, too sweet by far. Others got pig and grits and gave the dish a resounding \"meh.\" I unfortunately ordered the shrimp and grits, advertised as featuring, among other things, a Gruyere grits cake. Not. There was a tasteless lump of grits, beside which some shrimp and a lot of sausage swam in an overly spicy sauce that came halfway up the dish and completely overpowered all the other ingredients. The singer was decent and because of him I added a star to what would otherwise be a definite one-star review. We were really disappointed, and this food is not cheap.

As soon as you walk into Kadence, you get a sense that you are in for something different, something special. This is exactly the feeling the creators of Kadence want to curate for you. I probably already sound like I'm plagiarizing the other reviews here, but that must be because Kadence puts forth so much effort to ensure a consistently creative and unique experience. \n\nI went for their Sunday Kappo-style tasting. It's an abbreviated menu of seven truly unique courses. I am an adventurous eater, but I still encountered so many new flavors and textures throughout these courses. The space is small and intimate. I'll be honest--I felt like I was on some kind of celebrity tasting TV show. I was half expecting Alton Brown to walk out at any minute and be like \"Oh, hey Eric, give me your opinion on that last dish.\" \n\nService was some of the most attentive you can ever encounter, although this is made easy by the fact that you are sitting on one of ten stools in the place. My significant other purchased the sake flight for me. This was 3 pours of exceptionally divine liquids. As a light to moderate drinker, this was plenty enough for me. But if you want to be a little more woozy on the way out, you'll want to get the sake voyage, which I believe is 5 pours (and larger pours at that). \n\nAnything other than 5 stars would be a travesty, but this is Yelp, so you've got to have some complaints. There were perhaps 1 or 2 dishes I didn't care for -- this is just something you have to be prepared for when eating omakase (chef choice) style. I still appreciated the creativity and was intrigued to try something new. Also, I can't say the whole tasting sat well with my stomach afterward. Eating a lot of new things tends to make my stomach feel a bit at unease. If this is a serious problem for you, you may want to reconsider. Consider their sushi nights instead of their Sunday Kappo tastings, or don't go at all. It's not easy on the wallet, after all, so it's something you need everyone in your party to be committed to. \n\nDespite those minor complaints, I still want to return as soon as possible. I want to try their sushi night, even though it's a bit more experience. Unfortunately due to the price tag, it's something I will reserve for special occasions. But they will be occasions to look forward to - and occasions to remember for a long time. If you're in Orlando and you claim to love food, you have to go at least once. It's worth fighting for a reservation slot and forking over the cash.","DateTime":1512163702000,"Time_Only":"21:28:22","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"21","Date_Minute":"28"}

This steakhouse is in North Orlando away from the touristy areas. The clientele appears to be locals, regulars and special occassioners. We went to celebrate a retirement.  We started with salad. They only have large sized salads, but they were happy to split one between us. We got bone-in prime rib which was aged so it was nice and tender. The chefs cooked our well-seasoned and flavorful steaks correctly to rare and medium rare. We got lobster macaroni and cheese as a shared side. Almost every bite I got a chunk of lobster.  Because I told the restaurant it was a retirement celebration, they comp-ed out dessert which was a mandarin orange cake.   The cake was so moist and perfectly orangy.  The size of the dessert is definitely to share between 2 or more people. \n\nThe service was friendly and knowledgeable. There were three people taking care of us. One main waiter, one water and beverage, and one bus man. Water and beverages were perfect, and completed dishes and table crumbs were removed expertly.  \n\nThe atmosphere is what you would think of with a steakhouse.

My family and I went here and spent $93 for 4 Brisket sandwiches, 30 smoked wings, sides of Mac n baked beans n potato salad no drinks come with these orders mind you. So we originally came for the ribs I personally called to inquire about take out orders and the Dino rib( beef rib) for $25.99 for one, not a slab. The young lady never mentioned we out of ribs or we are getting low which I know that is out of her control on quantity but the customer service was very good. I'm just  a lil disappointed on how ppl are hyping this establishment on good food. Javon, I usually go by reviews and try for myself and today I did just that and to no avail, you were absolutely on point with this review. I feel so bad and couldn't eat my food. Potato salad too much mayo, fried shrimp was over cook being seafood takes a short min to cook. I'm sorry but I didn't and my fam didn't enjoy this. Also, one last thing idk what we received on the brisket sandwich but reason we ordered because it had coleslaw and pickles on it clearly we didn't get that based on my pic.","DateTime":1512165119000,"Time_Only":"21:51:59","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"21","Date_Minute":"51"}

We are thrilled with our new purchase! We worked with Cody who was wonderful and patient. We took our time making sure we were buying the perfect car for our family (several weeks), Cody was never pushy and refreshingly calm and honest. We would definitely buy from him again. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is for two specific reasons. One is that while in final negotiations for the price of my vehicle, the person who approves the final price sat in front of us and was not exactly kind. He was a little pushy and rude and spoke over my husband which I find incredibly disrespectful. The second reason is because of the miles that are on my new car. I bought it with a little over 3k miles because the owner's wife drove our car for a little while which would have been no issue if the car had been listed as a demo\/loaner which it never was. The cars need to be tracked and documented correctly at all times. I understand that we were able to get some additional dollars off of my car to compensate but proper documentation would have been appropriate. \nWe had considered buying an Expedition from Mac Haik the day before but luckily walked away from that deal (review on that nightmare to follow this one). We came in to buy our Expedition with our own financing. We had our pre-approval and paperwork from our credit union which means that all we had to do was sign purchasing paperwork which had nothing to do with financing. This also means that the dealership had ZERO need for our social security numbers. SSN's are only needed for financing. The other dealership told us it was the law that they needed our Social's. I called them out and then they said it was a company policy. It isn't. We told Covert that we didn't want to give them our SSN's since we already had financing arranged and they didn't once push us for this personal information. They were very respectful and we were able to move forward buying our car and everyone had a great experience. Once we agreed on final numbers and all parts of the \"deal\" Covert had the paperwork ready in 20 minutes, we signed and were able to move on with our day. \n\nWe would buy from Covert Ford again and absolutely recommend this dealership, especially Cody.\n\n\n\n*Info on why you do NOT need to supply your SSN if you have your own financing:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/financing\/cars\/buying-a-car-dont-fall-for-the-patriot-act-credit-check-scam\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.creditcards.com\/credit-card-news\/patriot-act-credit-check-scam-auto-car-loan.php\n\nBuyers, educate yourself before you let anyone run your credit ;)*","DateTime":1512165403000,"Time_Only":"21:56:43","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"21","Date_Minute":"56"}

Anyways, this was my first time getting lip fillers. The NP (her name may have been Ashely?) said that she was going to numb my lips, so she put VERY LITTLE numbing cream on my lips but only left it on for 3 minutes, my lips weren't even numb yet. This is a huge problem because I felt the entire procedure 100%. \nAnd if you havent had fillers before, they hurts!\n\nShe warned me that I could have SOME bruising... but I was already aware of that. \n\nShe began to inject my lips and after she was done my top lip was AWFUL (TO SAY THE LEAST)! A massive hematoma had formed and my lip was a quarter of an inch thick and was instantly black and blue. I instantly HATED my face and I literally couldnt leave my house for 4-5 days because it looked THAT BAD. \n-My boyfriend was worried i had permanently ruined my face, my dad told me i looked scary. \nHowever... after 1 week the awful swelling and black\/blue bruising finally went away and I did like the results (not to mention the bruising was also very noticeable under my nose for 4 days and looked like I had a mustache. UHG)\n-Also, the NP told me that my 'bruising' (aka massive black\/blue bulging upper lip) was a common reaction. Which is a LIE. Bruising is one thing... being careless is another.  \n\nSO, I waited a few months and finally went to a new Dr (Dr. Slater in Roswell) and he actually applied a generous amount of numbing cream and let me sit with it on for about 15 minutes. My lips and inside of my mouth was so numb I felt like I had already finished the procedure. \nI explained what happened to me at Ecobel and how worried I was because of my past experience. \nRegardless he did his magic and I left with not a SINGLE bruise! Not ONE! I had minimal swelling also! Which is crazy considering after leaving Ecobel my lips looked like I just lost an epic girl fight. \n\nGood luck... I wouldnt come back here. They have a groupon for a reason and if you are messing with your face just pay the extra  money to so you can walk out the door feeling confident about your purchase. \nAnd btw, Dr.Slater only charges $525 per syringe of Juvederm (which is cheaper than a lot of places in Atlanta).","DateTime":1512165958000,"Time_Only":"22:05:58","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"22","Date_Minute":"5"}

I grew up on Venezuelan food and I was traveling for business at the time.  The restaurant is located within the Brewery District.  Parking is best addressed by parking at the Courthouse Parking structure next door.  The menu seems pan Latin American and worth exploring.  That night I had Teque\u00f1os as my appetizer.  Some describe Teque\u00f1os as the gateway drug to Venezuelan cuisine.  What Teque\u00f1os are: lightly salty and easily melted white cheese with a pastry wrapping around the cheese, this is then deep fried.  Basically the Venezuelan version of the Mozzarella stick.  Dip it in the \"Cilantro\" sauce (available in Mild or Spicy)- Venezuelans call it \"Guasacaca\", it is made with avocadoes in a way similar to guacamole, and the Venezuelans use it like ketchup or mustard (goes on everything).  Dinner was Pabellon Criollo with a side of Tostones.  The Pabellon Criollo is shredded stewed beef with rice, plantains, and black beans.  Very similar to Ropa Vieja at a Cuban or Puerto Rican restaurant but with different spices.  I thought the beef was a little on the dry side, but that was a personal preference thing.  The arepitas were of yellow corn and tasted very much like Panamanian Tortillas (very good too).  The dish was excellent.  The tostones (twice fried plantains) were crunchy and excellent.  I should have asked for Cuban garlic sauce but I didn't see it on the menu.

She invited people to take a seat. The only way they could do this was to sit on the knees of other people or leave the boarding gate entirely and return to the overcrowded general concourse with even fewer seats which would be daft. \n\nShe ended this announcement cheerfully inviting the tired and impatient to enjoy 'happy holidays' now as an aside the term happy holidays is utilised not to offend non Christians rather than saying merry Christmas which is a Christian festival (albeit taken from a pagan ceremony). \n\nNeedless to say she was ignored so she made five more announcements in quick succession initially imploring eventually threatening customers to shift out of the way or else.

If you don't get that, well...you're going to have a disappointing stay, because the other perks are pretty lame. Value per day: $300 for MK views, $0 for other rooms.\n\nClub-level access: There are two Club-level only concierges and only once during the week did I see both of them busy, so you'll have great access to a knowledgeable concierge (on the 3rd floor of the Main building). You'll also have access to snacks throughout the day, including unlimited beverages (including cans of Coke products). Value per day: $50 unless you have a giant family that eats a lot.\n\nEvening Turndown: If you take a nap, they'll come in in the early evening and fix your sheets and give you chocolates. Value: $25\n\nComplimentary newspapers (maybe because the GF looks like it belongs in the 20th Century?), Complimentary fax assistance (seriously, they list this on the web page, and I have no idea why or what it means), Complimentary Health Club Access. Value: $20\/day if you use the Health club, otherwise these are silly.\n\nDVD player: Again, living in the 20th Century. Value: $0.\n\nAccess to Disney Signature Services - this is a slightly better service than standard Disney vacation help. Value: none if you know how to use a web browser.\n\nSo the extra value for these rooms? I put it at just about $400 if you get the Magic Kingdom view. And what do you know, a standard GF room is about $600\/night (again, these are off season prices).\n\nThe GF has some great things going for it:\n1) It's super close to the Magic Kingdom. One super quick Monorail stop away (going there) and one quick boat ride to MK (coming back).\n2) It's a gorgeous building (at a distance)\n3) The grounds are really nice.\n4) The staff is super nice and knowledgable.\n5) Even if you don't have a view of the fireworks from your balcony, you are only a few steps away from a great viewing spot right on the property.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks:\n1) There are two elevators that can take you to the club levels and back to the 1st\/2nd floors. Getting up there isn't too bad, but getting down can have you waiting ore than 5 minutes, 10 or more if it's early rope drop time.\n2) The rooms are in pretty bad shape. The toilet is a scant few inches off the ground and is tiny. The shower is in a standard tub and the water pressure is terrible. And the water has that funny Orlando smell. \n3) The Balconies are kind of dirty (ours had chipped paint, lots of dirt, spiderwebs, and just looked...old). The carpets and floor are in serious need of renovation. The furniture looks really dated too.\n4) The ceilings and doorways are super low. It's claustrophobic.\nThe exterior is dirty. I mean, how hard would it be to take a hose to the side of the building?\n5) It takes FOREVER to drive there from off-resort. The GF is the furthest resort from I4.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to stay, but it's far from perfect, and you're paying top dollar for location above all else.","DateTime":1512167355000,"Time_Only":"22:29:15","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"22","Date_Minute":"29"}

Upon selecting an insurance provider this year other than Kaiser, I was in need of establishing a new OB once I received a positive pregnancy test in September.\n\nBooking the appointment was easy and the receptionist explained that they prefer to see pregnant patients when they are between 8-10 weeks along so that the first ultrasound is really clear and dating of the pregnancy can be determined fully. It was explained that I would have a lengthy first appointment starting with the ultrasound, followed by meeting with the medical assistant and doctor and an exam and ending with lab work. I took the afternoon off from work for this appointment to be completed because it was explained to me that it would be lengthy, however, my appointment lasted less than an hour.\n\nVery long story short, we entered into the ultrasound first and were able to see the baby and heartbeat on the ultrasound imaging, however, the baby was measuring smaller than it should have been for how many weeks pregnant I was supposed to be. We were given printed photos of our ultrasound.  We were then escorted over to the exam room where the medical assistant came in and spoke with us and asked a lot of the necessary medical history questions. However, upon seeing the doctor, she only spent about 10 minutes with us. We were told that since our baby was measuring smaller than it should have been, that we should come back in one week to check on the growth of the fetus. No exam, no lab work. She said that she is not a fan of checking hormone levels via blood because they aren't that accurate. We booked an appointment for exactly one week later.\n\nUpon arriving for that second appointment, we were taken right into the ultrasound room and the technician spent a few minutes trying to get a good view of the baby. She was able to tell us right away that our baby hadn't really grown since the previous week. She took a few snapshots of the monitor and was quiet for a few moments. At that point, I asked about the heartbeat and she said she wasn't seeing one. I became understandably upset at that point and started crying. She excused herself and let me know I could take a few moments to collect myself and get dressed, and then she'd take us into the exam room. \n\nWe were met with the medical assistant in the exam room and then the doctor came in shortly thereafter. The doctor immediately began talking about my options, which was strange to hear within about five minutes of learning my baby had passed away and both my husband and I were visibly upset. She then slipped me a pamphlet about D&Cs, which I told her I'd like to avoid, or about using prescription pills to induce the miscarriage. She told me I didn't need to make a decision right then and that I should call if I needed anything. She also gave me a hug and told us she was sorry for our news, which I appreciated.\n\nI opted to receive the prescribed pills, and I called her office back a couple of hours later and spoke to her medical assistant to ask for the prescription order to be sent to my pharmacy. That was over a month ago and I haven't heard from this clinic since except to receive a bill for the first ultrasound, and an automated recording asking for the money to pay said bill. In my upset state after losing my baby, I began thinking about how nice it would have been if the doctor's office had called me in the days after my appointment there, and asked how I was doing...maybe inquired if I was in pain, had the miscarriage taken place, what were my symptoms? Could I use some pain medicine, did I need to come in for a checkup, how is my emotional level? For all intents and purposes, this clinic does not know if my miscarriage was complete or not, they never followed up on it again. There was no discussion of \"what comes next\"...it's in the course of doing my own research that I learned what most women could expect, when they could theoretically try for another baby, or what their symptoms are after the miscarriage process. And when going through something like this, I shouldn't have to rely on what \"the internet\" says, for what to expect for this type of thing... since I was naturally upset, I didn't think to ask those questions during my appointment, and perhaps the doctor's office itself, having seen this many times, could have thought to schedule a phone call with me to check on that. People should be given that kind of information from their doctors.","DateTime":1512167931000,"Time_Only":"22:38:51","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"22","Date_Minute":"38"}

In our experience, all levels of customer service respond in a very dismissive and curt manner, even after acknowledging evidence of incorrect or inconsistent information provided by them in their reservations and offer no apologies or any consolation.","DateTime":1512169532000,"Time_Only":"23:05:32","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"5"}

She doesn't just provide a relaxing experience, she truly heals your skin and provides long-term, personalized solutions. \n\nI've been seeing Mariola for nearly six-months. At my first visit, I told her I was desperate: My skin was red, dry, inflamed, and reactive to almost all products I tried--even organic. The woman who had helped me with my skin for two years no longer could. I had little faith that anyone could help. \nMariola told me to start from the very beginning, all the way back to my skin in adolescence. She asked me questions about my diet and lifestyle; her approach in questions was so integrated and in-depth before we even began the facial. She really listened. Half-way through the facial, Mariola stopped and brought me a mirror: all the redness in my face was gone. My skin actually glowed. I didn't think it was possible. I've been seeing her ever since.\n\nMariola blends her own oils that she gets in Europe, where standards and quality are much higher. Her personalized masks, oils, and Eminence products completely changed my skin. The best part: she doesn't push any products, and she takes a minimalist approach. I've told her I'll buy anything, and she'll still just choose a couple things for me--and make it clear she doesn't want me to overuse products. You don't find that often. \n\nAs for the facials themselves: They are two full hours! She uses a special massage technique to stimulate the muscles on your face, and gives a body massage to drain your lymphatic system. The aromatherapy is such a plus, too. \n\nSo, again, go to Mariola for so many reasons: she's warm and kind, her space feels as healing as it is, and your skin will transform into it's healthiest form. She's incredibly smart in all aspects of the human body and holistic health, and constantly is learning more herself. She just cares. I'm so grateful I found her.","DateTime":1512169648000,"Time_Only":"23:07:28","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"7"}

Very upscale look to the establishment. I'd give the DJ a 4 1\/2 out of 5. The food was DELICIOUS. I had the shrimp, substituted the rice for fries since I didn't want to hold a plate in my lap to eat rice. The portion size was so that I literally could not eat it all and I did try because it was THAT good. My friends had the wings and chicken strips and they said the food was delicious as well. The hookas were on point!! We had the mint and the house special. No dance floor \"technically\" but that did not stop us from dancing all night. Very comfortable couches to lounge, eat, drink, have a hookah, enjoy your friends and your life. Very casual dress even though I never follow that dress code when I go out...it's ladies night so of course I had to slay. The server came over at one point during the night to bring a round of shots to our table of 4. She said they were compliments of the owner who then came over to introduce himself and take a shot with us. Very classy IMO. The only \"down\" side once we got inside...service was slow and restrooms needed to be cleaned. Thankfully I utilized the facilities just before we were leaving for the night or I would not have been able to enjoy the evening and especially the food. Then again, I am very \"picky\" about the state of public restrooms in any establishment I frequent so it could just be me. I don't think so, but it could be. Nonetheless, I would recommend Pure Lounge hands down. Oh lastly, with regards to price, 18% gratuity included with any and every purchase no matter the party size and there is no splitting tickets.

My first experience was last night and I have thought of nothing else since. For starters, the staff greets you like family on Christmas Eve. I was half expecting someone to ask if I was ever going to get married.\n\nAlas, I made my way to the counter (we can call it an alter) and professed I had never been there before. The employee explained that water, tea and ranch were bottomless. The last bit about bottomless ranch really piqued my interest. So I ordered a Cold Breast for me and a Hot Breast for the Mrs back home (girlfriend of the year trophy is surely in the mail) then shuffled on down to the Ranch Oasis. Want to guess how many of those little cups I topped off? Six. That's like one cup for every star I wish I could give this little Mecca of Meat.  \n\nSo there I stood, waiting for my new Great Aunt to call my name while I pumped my bottomless ranch. I'm chalking it up to my cardio for the day. But just when I thought pumping ranch was difficult, the 30 minute drive home with wafting aromas of spices I probably can't even spell proved to be even more difficult. \n\nI drove like a bat out of hell the whole way up 23 counting down the seconds until I could eat my HCT. I'd be lying if I said I didn't dip a pinkie in one of the ranches at red lights. What can I say, I was famished from all the bottomless ranch pumping. \n\nI busted through the front door and had fork to face in under a minute. A new personal best. I didn't even take my coat off. The entire meal from start to finish changed me as a person. I usually am a very chatty dinner date, but last night we ate in silence. I was too busy mentally calculating how many miles I would need to run to make HCT a part of my weekly diet to be bothered with conversation. \n\nIn conclusion: this Christmas I will tell all my relatives that no, I don't know when I'm getting married, but I do know there will most certainly be bottomless ranch at the reception.","DateTime":1512170030000,"Time_Only":"23:13:50","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"13"}

By the time I rushed home, the awning had filled up with water, causing it to sag severely in the center from its normal height. Even though I put one side lower that the other,  a maneuver required by the company; the rain was coming too fast and overwhelmed the awning.  I tried to release the catchment of water with no luck.  A properly designed awning should be able to encounter heavy rains without immediately collapsing.\n\nI called many people including 2 engineers and could reach no one to get help. Finally, I was able to get two friends to come over. Before anything could be done, the awning collapsed on one person, pinning their arm between it and a metal chair. The arm was badly hurt so they rushed to the Emergency Department at Thomas Hospital to get it x-rayed.  My right rib was also damaged. Both of these matters could subject the manufacturer and dealer to serious lawsuits.\n\nWhile speaking to Sunsetter Awnings on Monday 10\/23\/17, Dillan, representative, requested that 2 incident reports be filed for the injuries sustained. He completed them and said he would send them to the Sunsetter Products Corporate Department. \n\nIt is a design flaw that caused this accident to happen. There are 4 legs\/arms that each have 2 levers that must be released to start telescoping each leg in PRIOR to being able to wind in the awning. The 2 legs\/arms are 20 feet apart from the other 2 which makes it difficult to operate.  \n\nThey sold me a defective and faulty designed product.  Immediately upon installation, the first heavy rain the next day, caused it to break in half. The main 20' aluminum bar across the front that carries the awning in and out, broke in half . ( there are 12 pictures to prove this statement ).\n\nIt is critical that these 2 companies (SunRay Home Solutions, Shalimar, Fl and SunSetter Awnings, Malden, MA) accept responsibility for the collapse of said awning and refund the entire amount paid in good faith by me for this product. \n\nIt is very fortunate that no one was killed when the weight of the awning and water collapsed to the ground. It is necessary that they stand behind their product.  The consumer must be protected from these dangerous products. If they continue to sell this particular design, other consumers will be hurt as well.\n\nOn Mon. 10\/23\/17,  I made numerous attempts to reach SunRay Home Solutions. The owner David Ray never responded to my calls. I spoke with the manufacturer,  Sunsetter Awnings, several times over a two week period.   They said they spoke with the dealer to no avail. \n\nI  wrote David Ray a certified letter Nov 2, 2017 stating that if they would not refund my money by Nov. 28, 2017,  he would force me to take them to court. To date 11\/16\/17, he has ignored my calls and letter. \n\nIn addition: I didn't mention the trouble getting the awning. 4 off 5 boxes came via UPS. One was lost. Then they found it a few wks later w\/ damage to the box which contained the awning itself. I didn't know whether to accept if the fabric might be damaged. I ended up accepting box. Salesperson agreed to come over and witness opening box in case the awning was damaged. It wasn't. That was nothing compared to the nightmare that followed.","DateTime":1512170058000,"Time_Only":"23:14:18","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"14"}

When we compare tickets we have the correct seats and so do they. These were good seats, centered on the stage. An usher comes to assist and since the other people were sitting first, they provided us with a new row of seats...further back and with a much worse view. Eventually we were placed in better seating but I just don't understand how the seats were double ticketed in the first place. IT seems to be common problem based on how the usher reacted and spoke to others about it. We ended up missing a couple of songs because of the issue.  They handled it just fine, but I would not have been happy with the original seats they were going to provide us and if someone in our party hadn't complained more I do not believe they would have provided the better seats that we were eventually given.\n\nThe place is very cute though and I appreciate its vintage vibe.

Loud.\n\nYes, I know it was Disney World and I was in 'The Happiest Place on Earth', for some people but please offer ear plugs and possibly a blindfold. What was I doing here you ask? My adult daughter who lives in Orlando suggested we should eat here because the prices were good for the amount of food. I left it up to her. She should know me by now, I am her mother and technically I have known her for all of her life. There is no price for my sanity! Don't get me wrong, I do like children because I do have one of my very own. I just did not know what I was walking into. \n\nThe adult child made reservations and we were seated right away. In the middle of the restaurant which was in the middle of EVERY THING! It was like a three ring circus and I was seated in the middle ring. I don't know... the loudness of people eating, the children screaming as if they were on vacation (oh right) and the servers yelling at you from the other table. I kept looking at my daughter and asking if our server was yelling at me. I could not decipher her voice from the other non-inside voices in this fine dining establishment. \n\nPlus the servers had this thing with ketchup. I really did not understand it but if someone asked for ketchup then the servers dropped what they were doing, yelled and hip-hollered then came running with ketchup. I really don't know, I was just happy that I did not like ketchup and told my daughter and her boyfriend that I would make them pay for lunch if they asked for ketchup.\n\nI placed my drink order and I skipped the wine. I skipped my pretty cocktails. I even skipped the beer that I do not drink. I went straight for the hard stuff. I chose Moonshine! Straight up MOONSHINE folks. I did not even question why they served it because the reason was all around me. The Moonshine flight had three small glasses of different types of pretty strong booze. This made Disney a little more magical at that moment.\n\nI let my daughter and her boyfriend do the ordering because I was distracted by the little kid parade on wooden horses passing by me. I thought to myself that this was an accident waiting to happen. Sure enough, one uncoordinated kid fell with the wooden horse and caused a domino effect. It looked like a Gappetto's woodshop massacre. Of course there was screaming and children had to be carried off. This is why I had only one child. \n\nThey ordered a never ending BBQ Skillet for three people and it was never ending. I do admit with all the chaos in the restaurant the food was good. I have no complaints on anything I ate. The BBQ was tender and the sides were great and kept on coming. I will say that this never ending BBQ skillet is the way to go if you decide to come here.\n\nI genuinely believe this place is great for little kids, I really do. I would not recommend this place to the Disney goers without children or those on their honeymoon and if you childless adults do come here, remember \"MOONSHINE!\".","DateTime":1512171207000,"Time_Only":"23:33:27","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"33"}

They are served in hot stone pots that seem to never lose heat, it was amazing because my very last spoon of rice was just as hot as the first! For an extra 50 cent, you can upgrade to black rice which I like more because of the extra bite that it gives. I really enjoyed my bimbimbap but I wish they added a runny egg on top to add a little more richness. As one of the other yelpers mentioned, they give the side dishes at the same time as your main course. I'd prefer if they gave the side dishes first so you have something to nibble on to stave off the hunger but I guess I could probably work on my patience too haha.

I have terrible joint mobility just about everywhere in my body. Bad positioning in a deadlift caused my third rib to dislocate two years ago. For nearly 18 months I was having off and on problems with it because I refused to stop lifting weights to take a step back and address the root cause. Traditional chiropractors told me I was suffering from a subluxated rib and didn't really offer solutions for long-term treatment. Dr. Neff quickly identified that the root of my issue was an impinged nerve in my trapezius which was causing both pain and the muscles in my back to tighten up and pull the rib out of place if they were put under enough strain. He gave me a set of mobility exercises using lacrosse balls and bands and some strength exercises to go with it. The results have been phenomenal as I have been without a major incident for 4 months.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Neff analyzed X-rays of my lumbar spine and prescribed an insole to correct for a shorter leg length that was throwing my hips out of a neutral position. Traditional chiropractors have told me that it was a tight hip flexor on the shorter side that was causing me problems. He also gave me a slew of hip mobility and glute strengthening exercises to eliminate low back pain and keep me moving. Often times I am able to come into the office before my appointment to do mobility work by taking advantage of the mat, rig, and other equipment laying about.\n\nMy point is that Dr. Neff cares about his patients and looks for the root cause of their issues rather than trying to make a quick buck by moving a joint alone. He attends seminars to stay up to date on the latest research and techniques, creates videos for mobility and targeted muscle exercises (akin to Kelly Starrett), and surrounds himself with knowledgeable staff members who specialize in physical therapy and massage therapy. If you seek out help from the folks at Truebility, you will be getting the full package and nothing short of it!

One of the few things I was concerned about was where I was going to get my hair cut. Even if my regular barber wasn't available back in NJ, I knew other barbers whom I can rely on for a cut in a pinch. It was never an issue to get fresh on a moments' notice. In Austin, I knew no one so I took to instagram and hopped from one barber-centric hashtag to the next with the hope that eventually that it would guide me to a shop with barbers that matched the skill and vibe that I'm accustomed to back home. \n\nEnter: SHED Barber and Supply. First off, I've never booked a haircut online so this was a great convenience for planning purposes. Second, the website provides a nice overview of the services they provide along with a bio for each barber. Finally, I read enough reviews to determine that every barber at SHED is pretty damn good. When I perused the schedule, I booked an appointment with Shantel who was the only barber available at the day and time I needed before a wedding I was set to attend. The results were outstanding. Shantel was great and had a great grasp of what I wanted and executed accordingly. Unfortunately, I also learned that she was relocating (womp) but again, you can't go wrong with anyone from the SHED crew. \n\nI had one last appointment with Shantel at the Holly location before she moved and then yesterday, I went to Justine and again, she too, hit it right out of the park. I wanted to go with a style that was a departure from how I've worn my hair for the past year. I didn't need to explain much and I was confident that Justine would be able to deliver. And she did. \n\n4 months after moving here, I'm happy that I've found a barber shop I can call my own and I would recommend SHED to anyone looking to get fresh. If nothing else, hit the grams and hashtag #BarberShopConnect and see where it takes you....look where it got me.","DateTime":1512171239000,"Time_Only":"23:33:59","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"33"}

I mentioned 3 things I would like them to look at- an alarm that was popping up on my dashboard that service was required for my blind spot alert system (this was going on for 3 weeks prior to me being able to get an appointment), ongoing low tire pressure, and examination of the power steering for a strange noise I was hearing. This dealership had my car for 4 days. They told me they were not seeing any alarms when they hooked up the car to their computer system, said they would test drive the car to see if they found the alarm but still could not find the alarm in relation to the blind spot monitoring system. In terms of my tires, they told me my chrome rims (which are 3 years old) were corroding, therefore causing build up between the tire and rim causing damage to a bead which prevents the tires from holding air. I got the run around about my power steering, and I honestly do not even feel that a mechanic even looked at my steering. I won't get into all the details, but they supposedly fixed my tires. When I picked my car up after 4 days of it being at the dealership, I turned on my car and within seconds my car alarmed and on my dash displayed \"blind spot alert unavailable service required\" as well as a low tire pressure light which showed 2 of my tires were low on air. The next morning, I turned on my car and again within seconds my car alarmed showing \"blind spot alert unavailable service required\" on the dash- an alarm that this dealership \"could not find\" for 4 days that they had my car, and yet after I had the car back for 8 hours, I got the alarm twice. I called the dealership and left a message. I again called the next morning and asked to speak to a service rep or a service manager.

I still do not understand why they chose to be located in an area where only a certain type of person can dine with them (people in Terminal A) but that is not the point of this review. \nThe point is I was overwhelmingly disappointed. While we were seated quickly it took 10 minutes for our server to come to our table. She took our drink order, which took another 10 minutes to get to us. Luckily we were ready to order or I would be concerned she wouldn't have come back. I ordered the meatloaf and my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken. \nThe main was good for both us us. The meatloaf had a good amount of flavor, but I did find the thick layer of ketchup to be overwhelming at times, and the Nashville hot chicken was delicious. The sides were what disappointed the most. Their supposedly famous mac and cheese was noodles with a yellow dried rubbery substance, that I guess they were claiming was cheese. The mashed potatoes were just fine and the other sides were the same. I just don't understand how this place has so much hype. I have had much better meatloafs, and sure it may have been one of a few places to have hot chicken before, but lots of places have them now, and their sides are bland, plain or disgusting.

Rip me all ya want but these are the type of cafes that give specialty coffee a bad rep. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are in town for a wedding and saw that this shop had a huge selection of single origin coffees and offered multiple manual brew processes so figured we'd check it out. I was even more excited to see that they offered a Kona coffee and a Colombian Geisha, both of which sell for over $40\/lb, and had both coffees available as a manual brew.  \n\nFrom the second we entered the shop everything started heading downhill. The barista couldn't understand my order of \"the geisha brewed on the clever dripper\" and we spent what felt like forever stumbling over words trying to help them understand what I was trying to order. \n\nI eventually got my coffee and was super disappointed. \nThe cup of coffee I received was over extracted, astringent on the tongue and was brewed at a lower temperature than specialty standards (198-203 degree). The cooler brew temperature lead to a stale cup of coffee with no depth. This should not be the case for a varietal of coffee that can sell for upwards of $300\/lb due to its floral vibrance and complexity. \n\nThe biggest red flag for me though was the fact that barista must have ran the coffee through the same grinder as their flavored coffees, as my cup picked up a heavy stale hazelnut coffee flavor that you would associate with any gas station coffee that never cleans their equipment. It blows my mind that a cafe can offer such a rare and respected coffee with zero care as to how the consumer is experiencing it. \n\n The lack of quality control for a shop that has so many \"specialty\" offerings astonishing. One of the first lines on their site talks about their baristas' knowledge, when it was extremely evident that there is no standard and no specialty training given to the cafe's employees. They seem to have some great coffees lined up but they're doing the industry an injustice by serving them improperly.","DateTime":1512172568000,"Time_Only":"23:56:08","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"56"}

If you have to use ATT don't get the insurance.","DateTime":1512172587000,"Time_Only":"23:56:27","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"56"}

They sell Cards Against Humanity here.\n\nWe only stayed for about 20 minutes since we were touring around DT Portland but man was this place packed! My dad was able to find a book that he had been waiting for and luckily it was just stocked that morning. \n\nI wish I had more time here I'd love to check out more of their cookbooks and coffee table books.

Overall the egg was cooked perfectly in that it was soft boiled but lacking in terms of soy sauce flavor. The noodles were Al dente and perfectly done, definitely a very enjoyable part of the meal. The meat was chewy but nothing mind blowing.

I am not a beer person, so it was nice that they had a cider that I could drink. They were having some local band play out on the patio. Maybe Im a grumpy grandpa on the inside but I really wished they would have kept the door to the patio closed. Im not a fan of live bands at bars, mainly because I like to talk to my friends when were out and not have to shout to barely hear each other. I was originally excited because I figured we could stay inside and not have to worry about the band. I was wrong. The patio door was propped open and it made little difference if we were inside or outside. \nThe place is scantly decorated and it really does feel like you are just sitting in a warehouse drinking and maybe thats the vibe they were going for. I will not be back, for the lack of selection of things other than beers (which I understand theyre a brewery, thats the point) mainly, but I also was not a fan of the place in general, just not my type of bar. I would not have picked this place to go if I had the choice.\nCool if you like beer and live music though, definitely come check it out!","DateTime":1512172761000,"Time_Only":"23:59:21","Date_Only":"2017-12-01","Date_Hour":"23","Date_Minute":"59"}
