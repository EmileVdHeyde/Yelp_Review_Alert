      "Message:  0.71963483,Reject,\"AfKexNut7ibhOqjRnN_IJQ,Stay away from Henna's Service Department! My Tahoe has been at Henna for 5 weeks now (with no loaner car) to get the rear A/C lines replaced: it took 2 weeks for someone to even look at the vehicle because Felix didn't bother answering calls or communicating after he'd told me at my appointment that it'd probably not be looked at for 2 days (the vehicle was looked at the same day that I got in touch with the service department manager Mark Wilson); another 1 week because of my third party warranty company; and now yet another 2 weeks because the mechanic works on it \\\"when he can.\\\" I'm told that he gets frustrated working on it and then works on something else. I'm sorry, but I have been paying for a month's car loan and insurance and getting no use out of it. I don't know why I didn't check online reviews (Facebook, Google, Yelp, etc.) before blindly taking my vehicle to Henna. The service department works hard to earn their overwhelmingly one-star reviews. In fact, I think my service advisor (Felix) has been mentioned the most in 1-star reviews. Frequently, the GM Mark Rowe responds to Yelp reviews with generic responses. For comparison, on Facebook and even Yelp, the number of 1-star reviews for Covert GMC is MUCH, MUCH lower, and many of them are responded to by the owner. Sometimes those reviews have a follow-up from the original poster saying \\\"resolved to my satisfaction.\\\" My wife and have had \\\"pleasant\\\" experiences obtaining service (including major service) for our various previous vehicles at dealerships ranging from Saturn to Covert GMC to Subaru of Austin to Maserati of Austin, and Henna has mind-blowingly, astoundingly poor customer service. If Felix had bothered to stay on top of the status of my vehicle and communicated from the start, I wouldn't be leaving this review. While still deployed a couple of months ago, I called initially to set up an appointment to bring my vehicle in, and I had to explain the desire to set up the appointment to three separate people before finally receiving an appointment. I later had to cancel that appointment because I was delayed in returning home, but I should have thought to check reviews given that incredibly inefficiency on the phone. In my opinion, Henna has one of three potential issues: 1) the dealership's acceptable service standard is to maintain a certain percentage of irate customers in order to minimize time spent on customers, 2) Felix is the worst project manager I've ever known (and I know a few incompetent ones), or 3) the service advisers are insanely busy and can't keep up. Any one of those three is the dealership's responsibility to fix if they want to have any repeat customers. Again to compare to Covert GMC, after my vehicle had been at Henna for 3 weeks I called Covert GMC up to find out the estimated time and cost to fix the A/C lines. The lady who answered the phone took the time to speak with service advisors and parts personnel to give an accurate quote, and swore up and down that the only time a vehicle was lost in the shop for 2 weeks was when they had a service advisor quit on them. Again, this was done with Covert GMC knowing that the vehicle was already in the shop at Henna so they were unlikely to get the business. Based on my experience and many online reviews, Henna has set themselves up as the gold standard for amazingly horrible customer service in the service department. I guess they need the countless 5-star reviews for their sales department in order to stay in business. Or perhaps the \\\"little guy\\\" like me always gets pushed for the fleet service like TxDPS.\"\n",

However Popeyes is not like all other fast food places because depending on who is in the kitchen things can go horribly wrong and the food will not taste like it's suppose to.\\nThis place is obviously brand spanking new and that in itself has its ups and downs, everything is new and clean but the restaurant staff is learning to crawl before they can actually run the place. \\n\\nThe food was bland, one of the reasons I like Popeyes chicken is because it's nicely seasoned but what this Clermont Popeyes served was bland not properly seasoned or marinated chicken, the fries were as expected although soggy, the gravy on the mash was salty as hell so that's the gist of it, it's either overly seasoned or under seasoned ugh annoying, and they left out my biscuit and jam which was a total bummer because it's the best part and it think it's impossible to mess up on biscuits.

When the waitress asked why I wasn't getting ramen, I told her about my allergy. She sweetly went to ask the chef, and came back saying that none of the ramens had soy in them. But when I looked at the menu, several of the ramens had \\\"miso\\\" in their title. I said I thought she was incorrect, she went back to check with the chef again, and came back with his message that miso isn't soy. I felt uncomfortable to even order sushi after that.\"\n",

I have been a fan of Peruvian food for some years now, having discovered the old Machu Picchu restaurant on Buford Highway. Most of the items on the menu were very familiar to me and we quickly chose the papa a la huancaina, pollo saltado, and the carapulcra. The carapulcra, or pork stew, was the only dish we had not had before. \\nThe papa a la huancaina was good, but not great. The sauce seem slightly lacking in flavor. The presentation was great and the portion was generous. Pollo saltado is a favorite in our house and we had high expectations. Unfortunately, it was a bit too salty for our tastes. It wasn't bad, just a little too salty. The carapulcra, however, was a solid winner. Just a really nice, uniquely flavored stew with lots of flavorful pork. It cam e with rice and fried yucca. The yucca could not have been prepared better. \\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and the service was great. It's a nice addition to Tucker's restaurant scene.\"\n",

I have a gluten sensitivity, not celiacs, and have had luck on my past two purchases. On the third however, I ordered the grilled deluxe sandwich and gluten free bun, the cashier rang it up as a multigrain bun. I clarified that I wanted gluten free and she said ok and explained how it came separately, I said that was perfect. When I got my sandwich I was asked to check the bun, it was pre assembled and obviously not the gluten free. I said again that I wanted gluten free and was brought another tray with the separate bun and toppings, which weren't the deluxe but rather the regular. I figured I'd just save the calories, no biggie, as I checked my receipt and wasn't charged for the deluxe. About 10 mins later I began having a reaction and am 99% positive that the toppings were just taken off my first sandwich and presented for the second sandwich, allowing cross contamination of sorts. Celiacs, IBS, and generally gluten sensitive people should just avoid.\"\n"

I'm especially allergic to gluten and dairy so I was excited YP had those options available like Maddios.\\n\\nFirst, we walked in and no one greeted us. We walked up to the station and no one was there, even though I saw the people in the back counter watch us walk in. A lady finally walked over and asked us what we want. \\n\\nI began to order a 7\\\" pizza for my grandma, who doesn't eat much and was probably going to throw out most of the 7\\\" pizza. The lady straight up said no... the conversation went like this...\\n\\nMe: Can I get a 7\\\" kids pizza\\nLady: No I can't do that\\nMe: Excuse me?\\nLady: There's no kids around \\nMe: My grandma is not going to eat a 10\\\" pizza, she's barely going to finish a 7\\\" pizza\\nLady: But she's not a kid\\nMe: I know that... but she will not eat a 10\\\" pizza alone. She barely eats, she's old. \\n\\nAnd his continued for a bit until she \\\"gave in\\\" and told the guy to make a kids cheese pizza... except for the fact that he had headphones in his ears and couldn't hear her. Instead of taking them off, they joked about it and he put them back in. \\n\\nMeanwhile, I was trying to order the next set of pizzas for me and my boyfriend because she kept rushing me and saying \\\"What else? What else do you want?\\\" before even starting the first pizza I ordered. \\n\\nBut each time I tried to order, she'd turn around to do something or say something to someone else and interrupted me mid-sentence each time I tried to order. \\n\\nHer: What else?\\nMe: I'll have a gluten free...\\nHer: (turns around to talk to someone else, then turns back to me) What else do you want?\\nMe: Yes, I'll have a gluten free pizza with vegan...\\nHer: (turns around and tells the other guy to make a kids pizza and turns back to me) Okay so you want white? White dough pizza?\\nMe: No. I said I want gluten free dough\\nHer: (turns around and walks away to the cashier and then comes back to me) What did you say you wanted?\\n\\nBy the 5th time she interrupted me (yes, 5th time) my boyfriend suggested we leave. Which to be honest, he's the patient one in the relationship so I was shocked when he made that suggestion. \\n\\nSo we told her and the other guy with the headphones never mind and walked right out. \\n\\nWe called Mellow Mushroom - they had gluten free and vegan cheese pizzas. We went there (which was down the street) and experienced way better customer service. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and skip this Your Pie location. Hopefully the other locations have better service but I'm pretty doubtful after this experience.\"\n",

The meat doesn't taste like anything special, plane buns that you can buy at the grocery store, regular cheese. I went here once and once was enough. I would say the burgers here taste kit a little better than a McDonald's burger but it's actually kinda pricey considering what you get. There really are so many better options out there.\"\n",
      "Message:  0.95771015,Reject,\"10I1lPr1X7ypQWdvwM5CUQ,Okay, here's what's good to order:\\n\\nA4. Szechwan spicy pork wontons ($7): I would've been content with just eating this for the night but I wanted soup, too. These are delicate, homemade wontons stuffed with pork. They're tender and slippery to grasp with chopsticks since they're soaking in their own sauce and oils. The sauce and oils give the wontons a juicy, soft texture and a mild sweet taste. There's 8 bite sized pieces enough to share evenly.\\n\\nB3. Hot & Spicy Noodle Soup ($10): This isn't a spicy dish either. A spicy sauce container sits at each table which helps increase the level since spicy turns out to be mild. The broth looks like it's going to hurt you later but it won't. The bowl contains a deceptively large quantity of hand-pulled noodles. Get this if you don't like thick noodles. Every ingredient from the noodles to pork to the baby bok choy tasted very good. I can't imagine eating this in one sitting but I'm sure someone has. It's a heavy meal.\\n\\nAll the appetizers are $7 and the noodle bowls are $10. There's flavored tea, milk tea, and hot tea to drink. If you sit near the entrance you can watch the noodles being made.\\n\\nService is something they could work on. Their impatience was noticed. It wasn't busy (several open tables) so we didn't feel there was a rush to leave. Multiple servers walked by looking at us for payment. After several passes we decided to continue our gathering elsewhere and paid. Other than this annoyance we enjoyed our meal and time at Noodle Man.\"\n",

My wife and I had recently visited several dealerships and were not impressed by the high pressure salesmanship and battered inventory. Ray was happy to provide me with lots of information over the phone, which was especially important because I was deciding whether to drive down from Seattle to look at it. They even had a YouTube video about the car on their website. When I arrived, the car was exactly as described, the Carfax was available, I was offered a test drive, etc. Ray even allowed me to sign a promissory note and come back the following day to pay for it. All in all it was a great experience and I'm happy to recommend this establishment.\"\n",

All are very casual bar tables. \\n\\nI tried the shoryuken ramen ($15). It's soy sauce based soup. It's a bit salty. It's not that flavorful. Pork neck chashiu is a bit sweet but good. Half egg is a bit too raw for ramen. The yolk is still runny. Yuba is ok without any tastes. The ramen itself is very ordinary, and less chewy than ramen in other ramen restaurants. \\n\\nThe hamachi crudo ($9) is expensive. You get five pieces of raw fish with crab sauce. The crab sauce is good, but the fish is a bit too fishy. \\n\\nIn general, I don't feel that the food or dining environment worths the price.

I've tried several of these fast-casual pizza places and I am just not impressed. So it is not this chain's or store's fault, It is alright like all the others, I am just not enamored with the concept; if I really want pizza I think I'll stick with the real thing. Probably idiosyncratic of me;I don't mean to dissuade; it is good enough for a three star. \\n\\nResiding in a gutted and well redone former BK in the curvey environs of Mill Run, they have reshaped the worn insides of the former to a spic & span space plotted out like a sports bar. My first time was on a lunch break and to catch the opening of Ohio State-Michigan since Yelp clued me on their TVs. I wanted to take ordering slowly--so I could get situated in a new environment and to get quickly updated on 'the game.' Unfortunately I felt very rushed by the clerk. She was almost frantic in speech and allowed me little time to get oriented asking me to approach the counter when as soon as I entered. My guess is there's some godawful metric in use judging employees on speed. If so not cool. If so management should reconsider that; metrics lead to fraud, stressed employees, low quality, and in this case a customer whose first interaction was slightly negative. \\n\\nI had a magic mushroom pizza-a pre-formulated option on the list of specialties, a fountain drink, and a coronary as Ohio State quickly went into 14-0 hole.  As for the pizza, which did come up fast ( it is counter served), I stuggle to explain my apathy without over criticizing it.  Hard to explain. Like all other like places I have experienced the toppings are fresh, the sauce is decent, the crust is bland but inoffensive. The best I can say is that it has no soul. Whatever that means. You eat it, it is there, you leave and forget. There is no belly warmth to say you had a good meal, no slight dopamine reward, no serotonin kick. I am not sure what it is. It is somewhat an exaggeration what I am going to say next but the phrase is in the ballpark;  it seems like your everyday GMC, school lunch pizza just with better topping and sauce. How that adds I don't know, but no fast-casual, single serving pizza places have wowed me yet. They all seem humdrum. \\n\\nThough if you like fast pizzas this place is fast, clean, and have good options. \\n\\nOptions? I wish Urban and staff would stop calling them. Oh well, the good guys eventually won the ballgame.\"\n"

But thanks to Dr. Elaine Gillaspie, that unsightly and annoying mole is gone for good.  Dr. Gillaspie used an innovative device, called an Ellman Surgitron, that precisely and painlessly effaced my mole in a period of about 20 minutes.  Two weeks later, only smooth, pink, healthy skin remains.  Over time, the pink color will fade, and so will my memories of that unwanted mole.  Thank you, Dr. Gillaspie, for providing this service.

I had made an online booking for a birthday party and was informed online that I would be contacted five days before the event. I received the message and called back....and back...and back. Their calls go directly to voicemail and no one calls back. I assumed my booking was cancelled since I wasn't able to get a hold of anyone so I went in person. The young man who was the lone worker there was helpful as he recalled my name but said I had to make another online booking as he had called his manager. He informed me to email head office who is really the managers Mike's email address. \\nI emailed him explaining the situation and how frustrated I was since the booking was supposed to be for three days away. His response was beyond unprofessional and so rude I can't believe he's the manager! I had sent a Google review which is under my married name and he called it \\\"fake!\\\" When I told him it's not as that account is under my ex-husbands name he replied \\\"lucky!\\\" Unbelievable! This was my email...\\n\\nTo whom it may concern,\\nI had originally made an online booking through your site for a party of 5 on December 3rd at 3pm. I received a tentative booking and was called a few days before the booking to request down payment to secure the spot.\\nI called back on five separate  occasions to provide my credit card payment and all times my call went straight to voicemail with no call backs! I went into your New Westminster location on December 30th at approximately 3:20pm to speak to someone in person since you don't seem to return calls or respond to emails! Prior to this I had made another online booking on Tuesday in case the original reservation was cancelled and no one responded to that email! The young gentlemen recalled my name and when I explained to him I had try to call on numerous occasions with no response he informed me due to your Langley location being closed for renovations they have been overwhelmed and not have been able to respond to calls! He called the manager who was of little help and then told me to email head office in hopes this situation will be rectified before the weekend!\\nI have to say I have not at all been impressed with the level of customer service I have received or should I say not have received. It is inexcusable for a company to not respond to phone calls! It seems all calls go to voicemail with no one responding!\\nThe only reason I am pursuing  this is that my son has been so looking to Planet Lazer to celebrate his10th Birthday with his friends. I sincerely hope you are able to resolve this matter!\\nSincerely,\\nRachel Kutney \\n...this was his response \\n\\nWe have replied to both your google review and your emails\\nCheck your junk folder\\nYou do not have a booking with us nor will we accept one from you\\nThis is a bogus email - much like your bogus google account - no need to reply to it, it isn't checked \\n\\nNice!\"\n"

It is seriously one the worst post sale experiences I've had in my lifetime. I bought a Rogue in 2016 and it has been next to impossible to even speak to someone in the service department let alone get service. Same thing in September when I tried to get nitrogen in the tires. There for 15 minutes. No one even acknowledged me let alone spoke to me nor did anyone come out to speak to the eight people before me. The receptionist in the sales room was not helpful and what a surprise the general manager wasn't there. This is the same experience I've had with each of my past visits. No one answers the phone and if they do they say hold on let me transfer you to the correct person/department and then you are just left on an endlessly ringing line. If you get to leave a voice mail they don't call you back. The post sale experience has ensured I will never buy another Nissan from Clay Cooley and likely not at all. Interestingly when I left this review on facebook it didn't take the general manager more than twenty minutes to respond and offer help or at least he did so in a public comment. It remains unclear why you cant get that kind of response in person or on the phone. I'd drive to Dallas for an oil change before I'd step foot back in this dealership. I've since taken my Rogue to Town North Nissian. There is definite improvement in that they at least acknowledge you when you are physically there and they do answer the phone but even there my service rep didn't want to investigate the chirping/rattling from the hatch. It's as if the Nissan service team members are not aware that every interaction with them is shaping the customers decision as to whether or not to purchase another Nissan in the future. It's a shame because I like vehicle, minus the rattle at 10K miles.\"\n"

Then told her go to the yellow chair she counted her teeth. Poked at 4 teeth\\nWith the explorer. She Didn't floss them only one, she didn't clean them only 2, then put fluoride gel and said she's all set. She told me no cavities and Brush better with water!!! I said I brush twice a day with pea sized toothpaste. She said toothpaste is secondary it doesn't matter for a four year old. I said so how do you expect it to be clean then??? She needs a pea sized toothpaste. My daughter Literally sat In the chair for less than 2 minutes and the hygienist said your done Goodbye. I said excuse me?? I told her when you do a cleaning, first you have to take the X-rays then floss in between each tooth then clean each tooth meaning each surface of all the teeth then let her rinse and spit out then lastly you put the fluoride gel on. And make sure in between she doesn't swallow anything. Then she'll be all set. I made her do everything over. She said how do you know?? I said I'm in the dental field. Where??? I said tufts university pediatrics. I told her you did nothing for my daughter so I'm going to another dental office. She got scared and told me sit back down I didn't know you knew so much, sorry I didn't know you were in the dental field. If you weren't in the dental field you wouldn't have known I did nothing.. ugh!!! I said I am in the dental field that's why I'm so specific how to do the cleaning. and I made her do everything over. I said first floss, She yelled I did floss look at all the blood on the floss!!! I said what blood??  you flossed one tooth. Do it over please in all the teeth. She said with the same floss or different?? I said different. I said where's the dentist she said she's not here yet she takes a train in. Why you want to wait for her?? I said it would be nice to see a dentist. As I was leaving the dentist came in and looked at my daughters teeth and said great job mommy. You take great care of your daughters teeth. No cavities. I said I know thanks have a nice day dr. And left. I will never set foot in this office again. They care about getting the child in and out within 5 minutes and they care about only the money not the quality of the child's health. I will never recommend this office to anyone. Beware of them.

As I walked out. The child walked out 2 minutes later. That means she got him in and out real quick. Greedy people. They are only hungry for money. They don't do their job right. They should be ashamed of themselves. I was so disappointed. I didn't leave until everything was done the right way. Every child deserves correct treatment.

MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.\\n\\nOLD MAN RECORDS ME AT GOODLIFE SOVEREIGN METROTOWN, AND NOTHING WAS DONE THANKS TO BEN (CLUB MANAGER)\\n\\nOn November 20th, I was working out at Goodlife Metrotown when a stranger approached me and told me that there was an older man (50-60 years old) recording me on his phone as he walked by. When he pointed to which man it was, I recognized him immediately. The old man has been acting strange around me since I joined the gym. For example, he would come very close to me and start exercising. Sometimes he would just stand near me and often walk close to me when it was unnecessary to do so. The man already had me feeling uncomfortable.\\n\\nI told the front desk staff including a personal trainer what had happened, and they assured me that they would take care of it and talk to the older man. Fast forward 10 days later and the man was still getting too close and acting weird. And when we asked if he had been talked to, the staff said no... I told my boyfriend what happened, so he approached the man and got into an altercation with him (no violence). One of the managers notified me that they reviewed the tapes, and found the moment when the old man walked by me, with his phone pointed directly at me. They even found the stranger who caught him, and they said that they would talk to him too. They made it appear that they had enough evidence to ban the old man. I thought I was safe to come back to the gym...\\n\\nBut unfortunately, earlier today (November 30, 2017) my boyfriend and I were approached by the club manager, Ben. Ben said that he talked to the older man and he believed that the event didn't take place (despite video evidence, despite what his colleagues thought of the surveillance, and despite what the witness said). He said the video doesn't show any \\\"obvious\\\" filming and that he was siding with the older man. When I asked about the witness, Ben told me that he hasn't talked to the witness yet. He also told me that they would not be banning the old man, despite not talking to the witness. What's sickening is that he informed me that the older man feels uncomfortable at the gym because of my boyfriend. \\n\\nBen told us that to be able to continue training at Goodlife, we will have to remain civil with the old man. My stomach dropped as I heard that. I felt like I was slapped in the face. Called a liar. I felt like Ben was playing a cruel joke on me. I told Ben, right then and there, to cancel my membership. Instead of acting comforting, Ben didn't say anything, he just got up, walked to the computer and canceled my membership. The whole ordeal felt as if he was banning me; the girl who was recorded by a sick old man.\\n\\nThanks, Ben. Guys like you are the reason women feel so uncomfortable at gyms. It took me years to finally set foot in the gym, and now I've been kicked out of one. I can't imagine how many times the old man filmed me in the past. And it makes me feel sick thinking about what he was doing with the videos. \\n\\nLadies, please be very careful of your surroundings, when you feel uncomfortable, it's most likely for a good reason.

I don't end up in these craft stores all that much, but if I need some supplies or frames, decorations, etc, I'll definitely stop in here.\\n\\nThe only thing we forgot to ask (because we had a great coupon discount) is if they have a \\\"teacher discount\\\" because I know sometimes these stores do.\"\n",

They were not too tight, and my edges did not break off...in fact, my edges are doing better than they were before I got the braids. We had a bit of a scheduling snafoo which made it take longer than expected, but I don't think that was a normal or purposeful issue (technology).

If you like ramen noodles from the little square package this is not the place for you. Here you will experience a broth that has been simmering to perfection for over 14 hours and tender fresh noodles.  There are a variety of flavors and levels of spice. My go to is the Spicy Miso Paitan Ramen.  If you like it really spicy you can easily ask for more hot oil on the side. This broth is rich, velvety and has a milky texture, you can literally see the richness. This bowl comes with Chinese mushrooms,corn ( I get extra),spring onion, a soft boiled egg and pork belly or tenderloin to accompany the wavy ramen noodles.  The best part is since they give you so much if you can't finish all your broth you can get an extra order of wavy noodle when they pack it up for you. Oh and you should definitely get some appetizers here they are all fantastic my go to is typically the crab taco and you should get extra pickles because they are amazing and made in house. Note this place is closed on Monday and no matter how much you end up loving it you can't get in on Monday and believe me I tried\"\n",

The entire experience is thoughtfully curated with fresh, seasonal ingredients.  Chef Ungar and his team have done an incredible job!\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS:\\n- Ticketed reservation system\\nLunch (Wed-Sat) $65\\nDinner (Wed-Sat) $195\\n- Natural Wine Bar Tuesday-Saturday nights\\n- Intimate Chef's Counter\\n- Accommodating for dietary restrictions\\n\\nWe were lucky enough to get last minute reservations through their ticketing system online the night prior for a Friday lunch. Most options are sold out several days in advance. The experience begins when you're selecting ticket options, a neat way to leave your wallet at home and not have to worry about payment. There is no ordering involved, but you are able to set up your guest profile and select beverage pairings (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) and give dietary/allergy info.  I was very impressed that their policy states that they are able to \\\"happily accommodate nearly any diet\\\"; at nicer fine dining establishments that have set menus, this isn't typically a luxury!  Tasting Counter welcomes pescetarians, vegetarians, and vegans.  Among the other tasting menu type restaurants I've been to (Chef's Fare @ Brooklyn Table, Feastly and LQ Foodings Pop-ups) Tasting Counter has truly curated an enjoyable, intimate dining experience.\\n\\nAs stated on their website, all tickets are inclusive of your meal, beverage pairings, tax & tip.  At $65/person, dining at Tasting Counter was worth every penny.  You see your food prepared right before your eyes at a dining counter that seats up to 20, surrounding their prep kitchen where every dish is plated in front of you..  The venue also becomes a wine bar during certain non-tasting menu hours (Tuesdays 5pm-12:30am, Wed through Sat 10:30pm-12:30am) and no reservations are needed.  It is located near a brewery and a rock climbing gym.  The venue is very warm and inviting, with their wine collection on one side of the back wall, as well as their herb garden.\\n\\nUpon getting seated, Chef Ungar personally introduced himself to everyone seated around the counter in two's or three's and explained their philosophy of \\\"0 carbon, 50 local, 100 natural\\\".  They strive toward a zero carbon footprint, sourcing at least 50% of their products from within the state of Massachusetts and serving all natural foods and wines.  The 5 course lunch menu was very well paired with beverages (I chose wine), with a mix of English, Asian, and French flavors.  The chef and sommelier were very descriptive with the food and beverage, and engage every guest.  Truly a wonderful find during my time in Boston.\\n\\nTasting Counter Lunch Menu (11/2017)\\n\\nWelcoming Bites\\nMarscapone Puff, 'French Onion Soup' Bite (onion, gruyere, sourdough), Smoked ocean trout belly\\n\\nGremolata Dumplings\\nSea urchin, hen of the woods, soured cream, preserved lemon\\n\\nSchisandra tea with pine nut\\n\\nEuropean Sea Bass\\nPine mushroom, daikon radish, black olive\\n\\nChestnut Dessert\\nhazelnut, date, duck liver, chocolate sorbet\\n\\nParting Morsels\\nCanele - goat milk caramel & juniper\\nCranberry fruit chew w/ fennel sugar\\nSunflower seed praline chocolate piece\\n\\nCan't wait to return to Tasting Counter for another dining experience or for their natural wine bar.  Highly recommend!\"\n"

We had only been previously to Market for drinks. While the food service is walk up ordering, they give you a number and bring your order to your table. \\n\\nBenjamin came right over to our table, asked if we had been in before, explained the new concept, described in detail what each of the three restaurants had to offer, and made recommendations for each one. He was so friendly, knowledgeable, down-to-earth and genuinely treated us like we were friends in his place. He made me feel like we were the only ones there, even thought he had a full bar and a few other tables.  He was able to make spot on beer recommendations for me as I was very indecisive of what I wanted to try that night. My friend knew what she wanted from the cocktails, but he was also engaging with her on ingredients and selecting a second cocktail. \\nHe checked back on us often and was still charismatic and efficient. \\n\\nWe ended up trying a few things and sharing as everything was very tempting from all of the restaurants. We split a Di Carne pizza from 081 Wood Fired Pizza, a grilled cheese, & a brisket taco from Gnarly Barley.\\nThe pizza had pepperoni, salami, sausage, prosciutto, mozzarella & parmesan. It was very, very good. The wood fire cooking makes all the difference! The dough was not too thick enabling you to taste all the other flavors from the toppings. It was a good personal size or perfect for sharing if you want to try other food options or sides. \\nThe grilled cheese was incredible! It's not your typical grilled cheese from childhood.  We asked for a recommendation and she made us a cheddar, blue cheese & swiss sandwich. I don't know what kind of bread it was, but the combination of the cheeses and the bread was fantastic! They also had several other sandwich options as well as soup, side salads and tacos. \\nI tried the brisket taco from Gnarly Barley as well. The meat portion was very generous and had a great subtle smoky flavor. The pico didn't over power it and it was a perfect portion size. \\nI only regret I didn't have room to try something from Da Kine Poke.

He is the sole reason that this place is great. Whenever there is a DJ substituting him it's never fun. DJ T Rex will always listen to recommendations and make sure the night is a good night for all.
