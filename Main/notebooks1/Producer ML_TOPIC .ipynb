Just recently on my way to work I ordered a large white chocolate mocha for walk up. I received it a few minutes after it was ready for me as the barista got distracted from the dog on the drive thru side. I finally get my coffee and head to work. I open up my coffee to check to see if it's always full. I look inside and it's 3/4 full (no drinks have been taken) and already cooled down and not hot enough. Will I be returning? Absolutely. Just because of one mistake, doesn't mean I won't go back there. Other than the distraction and less coffee, the baristas are great and take care of you as fast as they can when it's busy.\n",

      "Message:  rRQCXz5JXCAJXZqsV5JiMw,My budgie was sick for a couple of days.  I had another appointment for Thursday at another place, but i saw she was really ill.  I contacted Lavista animal hospital to see if they had a Avian vet.  They said they do and that she also has a mobile vet service and would come to me.  I called Dr Tobias to see if she could see my bird and told her I didn't have a lot of money but wanted to do what i could to see what's wrong with her and to make her comfortable.  When i talked to her she asked me to bring the bird in and I said Ok.  I asked her how much it would cost.  She told me the exam would be $65.00 I said okay.  Let me tell you about my horror story.  I arrived at Lavista animal hospital around 5:35pm  My Budgie was at the bottom of the cage with rapid breathing and very very fluffed (signs of a dying bird) She also had a swollen bald bottom.   I was thinking maybe egg bound.  She takes her out the cage and looks at her bottom.  Sticks a long Q Tip in her bottom.  She's squeaking every time she does it.   She saids she doesn't think she is eggbound and told me she was going to give her an x-ray, didn't ask if I wanted an x-ray just took her off and supposedly did it.  (5 MINUTES) later.  I mean just 5 minutes later, she comes back and says there's no egg or mass in her bottom (never showed me an x-ray) and says she gave her shot inside her wing (never asked me if she could), gave her an antibiotic (never asked me if she could) and gave her a lube inside her cloaca.  When my bird was put back in the cage she was far worse then when i bought her in.  She died around 2am that night.  I was charged $85.00 for exam (told it would be 65) X-ray 65.00, shot $25.00 antibiotic tabs 28.00, Lube cloaca $1.96.  I got charged $204.96 and watch my budgie suffer and die.\n",

Two of us ordered steaks, and they just didn't taste good.  The glaze on them was different than we'd expect in a steak house.  My top sirloin steak was the shape of a pork tenderloin rather than flat.  This was a very different experience than we've ever had a steak house.  It might have been a bad day for them, but the intense wood-firing may be taking away from the taste one expects from steaks.\n",

Its a QSR so you place your order at the counter pay and they will bring your order to you. So me being from Los Angeles i know a thing or too about Korean food and it's flavors.

As a vegan I wasn't sure what my options would be but was happy to find out they have almond milk that can be subbed in most drinks. I got an iced chai latte with almond milk and it was great! It was a bit noisy inside but there was plenty  of outdoor seating so we moved out there. Can't speak for the vegan or gluten-free food options since I didn't look at the food menu. My suggestions would be for them to have multiple dairy-free milk options (my mom wouldn't be able to order most drinks because she can't have dairy or almond, or soy for that matter), and to have a \"for here\" option on the cups for iced drinks (single-use plastics are very wasteful).\n",

      "Message:  nJ-MlCGD0XkYWdkQuhBA9A,A family member was admitted from an area hospital on a 1013 hold after self-harm.  The behavioral health person at the hospital indicated that during the 72 hour hold, he would be receiving group and individual therapy.  He was also told that his special dietary needs (due to a food allergy) could be accomodated and that Peachford had a chef who would provide meals he could eat.  The person who did the initial intake was efficient and once that was complete, family members had to leave.  At this point, he was taken to the unit and assigned to a room.  He was told that he would see the psychiatrist who would be treating him within a couple of hours.  He also had a newly stitched wound that should have received medical attention throughout his stay.  He was provided a meal during the intake process, however, once he was placed in a unit, he was only given the options in the cafeteria, which meant that he had very little to eat.  He did not see a psychiatrist that day (intake was on a Thursday morning about 9:00 a.m.), that night or the next morning.  His wound was not monitored.  Most disturbing, he was not given the anti-depressant medication that he was prescribed, even though stopping it abruptly was dangerous.  He attended various group therapy sessions, none of which were specific to what he was being treated for (depression) but were focused on substance abuse.  There was also a lot of religious propaganda in these sessions, although this hospital is not affiliated with a church of any kind.  He finally saw a physician that afternoon for literally two minutes.  The doctor looked at his information, did not look at the physical wound, did not release his regular medication to the nurses to give him, and told him that he would not receive any individual counseling because \"this is not that kind of facility.\"  That night, he was given medication that was not his regular meds, but an anti-psychotic because \"everyone has to take them.\"   We called his regular psychiatrist and reported what was happening to him; he was concerned about him not receiving his regular medication and going into withdrawal, and called the psychiatrist on staff to ask about this.  He was never contacted back by the hospital.  The next day passed without receiving medication and the entire family became extremely concerned.  He decided to request to be discharged against medical advice, which was a BIG mistake, as this simply gave them the right to hold him longer (more $$$).  He was also no longer allowed to eat meals in the cafeteria because his request was considered a danger for him to try to run away.  Still not receiving medication and being forced to take anti-psychotic.  Supposed to be getting a daily visit with the psychiatrist - one of these \"visits\" occurred in a hallway when our family member happened to run into the doctor.  When a visiting day came, we arrived and were directed to the wrong unit THREE TIMES by the staff at the lobby desk.  After four days without his prescribed medication, he was finally given it.  The wound had still not been monitored at all.    Four days after admitting, we were given an appointment (called family therapy - it's not) to get ready to release, but it was the weekend.  The doctor wouldn't release him that day.  FIve days after admitting, he was released.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This hospitalization was a horrible experience for someone who was in need of help.  Basically, they hold your family member for a certain number of days without providing any treatment whatsoever.  (If you don't have insurance, they will send you home, however.)  It was of no help at all.  We were fortunate afterward to get good help after the hospitalization, which helped tremendously, but this could have been an experience that made the entire situation worse.  The staff were mostly rude and often seemed incompetent.  The social worker who did the release \"family therapy\" was nice, but she basically asked a bunch of questions that were a legal \"cover your ass\" for the hospital.  Dr. Naveed Ummed was rude and seemed uninterested in doing anything beyond checking the boxes he has to check to get his paycheck.  To say he has no bedside manner is an understatement.  \n",

With plenty of parking options, I pulled in and walked to the door.  The restaurant doesn't open until 5pm (not sure what the hours prior are) and I had gotten there at 4:59pm.  As soon as I get to the door it is unlocked and in we go.  It is nicely decorated and very clean.  First impression of the restaurant looks positive. \n",

She brings my water and gives me a moment to go over the menu.  The menu has so many traditional options as well as what appeared to be Chinese food options.  I settled on the Spring rolls and Pineapple Fried Rice.  Doesn't take long and the spring rolls arrive.  Delicious but small portion. Later, the Pineapple Fried Rice comes and its literally the rice in the pineapple! Love it! I had never seen that before and it did add a nice smile to my face.  The food was just as good as the presentation.  It came with peanuts on the top which I didn't like but that is on me since I didn't read the item description fully.  I simply pushed the peanuts to the side and went to town.  It was awesome.  \n",

Only reason why this place doesn't give a full five stars was because my waitress was a little AWOL and I ended up having to call someone else to fill my water and bring more sauce.  The waitress definitely felt bad as she then began to hover near my table but at that point I was nearly done.  I know it seems harsh to knock a star for that but I keep it real with my reviews.  I am sure next time I go there, it won't happen again.  I look forward to coming back!\n",

      "Message:  AfKexNut7ibhOqjRnN_IJQ,Stay away from Henna's Service Department! My Tahoe has been at Henna for 5 weeks now (with no loaner car) to get the rear A/C lines replaced: it took 2 weeks for someone to even look at the vehicle because Felix didn't bother answering calls or communicating after he'd told me at my appointment that it'd probably not be looked at for 2 days (the vehicle was looked at the same day that I got in touch with the service department manager Mark Wilson); another 1 week because of my third party warranty company; and now yet another 2 weeks because the mechanic works on it \"when he can.\" I'm told that he gets frustrated working on it and then works on something else. I'm sorry, but I have been paying for a month's car loan and insurance and getting no use out of it. I don't know why I didn't check online reviews (Facebook, Google, Yelp, etc.) before blindly taking my vehicle to Henna. The service department works hard to earn their overwhelmingly one-star reviews. In fact, I think my service advisor (Felix) has been mentioned the most in 1-star reviews. Frequently, the GM Mark Rowe responds to Yelp reviews with generic responses. For comparison, on Facebook and even Yelp, the number of 1-star reviews for Covert GMC is MUCH, MUCH lower, and many of them are responded to by the owner. Sometimes those reviews have a follow-up from the original poster saying \"resolved to my satisfaction.\" My wife and have had \"pleasant\" experiences obtaining service (including major service) for our various previous vehicles at dealerships ranging from Saturn to Covert GMC to Subaru of Austin to Maserati of Austin, and Henna has mind-blowingly, astoundingly poor customer service. If Felix had bothered to stay on top of the status of my vehicle and communicated from the start, I wouldn't be leaving this review. While still deployed a couple of months ago, I called initially to set up an appointment to bring my vehicle in, and I had to explain the desire to set up the appointment to three separate people before finally receiving an appointment. I later had to cancel that appointment because I was delayed in returning home, but I should have thought to check reviews given that incredibly inefficiency on the phone. In my opinion, Henna has one of three potential issues: 1) the dealership's acceptable service standard is to maintain a certain percentage of irate customers in order to minimize time spent on customers, 2) Felix is the worst project manager I've ever known (and I know a few incompetent ones), or 3) the service advisers are insanely busy and can't keep up. Any one of those three is the dealership's responsibility to fix if they want to have any repeat customers. Again to compare to Covert GMC, after my vehicle had been at Henna for 3 weeks I called Covert GMC up to find out the estimated time and cost to fix the A/C lines. The lady who answered the phone took the time to speak with service advisors and parts personnel to give an accurate quote, and swore up and down that the only time a vehicle was lost in the shop for 2 weeks was when they had a service advisor quit on them. Again, this was done with Covert GMC knowing that the vehicle was already in the shop at Henna so they were unlikely to get the business. Based on my experience and many online reviews, Henna has set themselves up as the gold standard for amazingly horrible customer service in the service department. I guess they need the countless 5-star reviews for their sales department in order to stay in business. Or perhaps the \"little guy\" like me always gets pushed for the fleet service like TxDPS.\n",

      "Message:  7TEc3JWeIvPtvlmwLngB4A,I had Allstar install a small fenced area complete with 3 stone pillars to serve as a dog run on the side of my home about 2 years ago when I moved in. Some of the stones on the center pillar were not properly stacked with mortar and a top stone wasn't even adhered down to the pillar. At the time, my ex had been handling the logistics of getting the team to come back and fix it. They never did. a year and change go by and now I am selling the home and need to get this repaired at a buyer's request. A few weeks back I connected with Derek. He was as friendly as I remembered and assumed this would be taken care of no problem. Since then, not only has he not come out, no one is answering calls. The work was shoddy when it was done and they don't appear willing to come and make it right. I would suggest anyone dealing with this company pay half up front and half when the job is done, I wouldn't trust this outfit.\n",

It took a short while for someone to take our order and for the drinks to come. No problem so far. But 45 minutes after ordering an appetizer we still were waiting. Then a table that was seated a good 15 minutes after us got theirs so I finally spoke up. Turns out our waiter had to leave so our order was never put in. When we indicated that we were ready to leave rather than wait longer our drinks were comped so kudos for that gesture. I would probably give this place a second chance with hopefully a higher rating.\n",

Most of the items on the menu were very familiar to me and we quickly chose the papa a la huancaina, pollo saltado, and the carapulcra. The carapulcra, or pork stew, was the only dish we had not had before. \n",
      "The papa a la huancaina was good, but not great. The sauce seem slightly lacking in flavor. The presentation was great and the portion was generous. Pollo saltado is a favorite in our house and we had high expectations. Unfortunately, it was a bit too salty for our tastes. It wasn't bad, just a little too salty. The carapulcra, however, was a solid winner. Just a really nice, uniquely flavored stew with lots of flavorful pork. It cam e with rice and fried yucca. The yucca could not have been prepared better. \n",

First let me say I love the retro look inside and the staff was super nice and helpful. Since this was my first time the cashier made lots of suggestions and I enjoyed it all. I almost ordered too much because i was hungry not realizing how big certain items would be. So I had a hot dog split on the grill amaze-balls. I also ordered the bacon-double cheeseburger (note to self only get single next time or only order the double) the patties where big and well seasoned and cooked to my liking medium well. I also had the beer battered onion rings and OMG I'm in love. And to wash it all down I had a thick vanilla milkshake. The entire meal cost me $22 and it was well worth the cost. My only issue is everything is a la carte. They should think of making some combo burger/hotdog meals. Other than that I loved it all and will go again.\n",

I have a gluten sensitivity, not celiacs, and have had luck on my past two purchases. On the third however, I ordered the grilled deluxe sandwich and gluten free bun, the cashier rang it up as a multigrain bun. I clarified that I wanted gluten free and she said ok and explained how it came separately, I said that was perfect. When I got my sandwich I was asked to check the bun, it was pre assembled and obviously not the gluten free. I said again that I wanted gluten free and was brought another tray with the separate bun and toppings, which weren't the deluxe but rather the regular. I figured I'd just save the calories, no biggie, as I checked my receipt and wasn't charged for the deluxe. About 10 mins later I began having a reaction and am 99% positive that the toppings were just taken off my first sandwich and presented for the second sandwich, allowing cross contamination of sorts. Celiacs, IBS, and generally gluten sensitive people should just avoid.\n",

I was thoroughly impressed with the Museum. A gentleman by the name of Miles was our tour guide for the day. There was so many special Artifacts that a story of its own. The exhibit museum focuses on Africa's origin and the introduction of the slave trade in the 1700 and 1800s. I won't go into too much detail because it's something one who is either a native or Atlanta or non-native should experience. The museum is only 8 minutes from the Peachtree Station and is located in the heart of downtown Atlanta. If you decide to drive there, parking would be a bit of a challenge.\n",

You can quickly and easily tell the quality of product they use from the first bite. Yes it does cost a little more than the other places on the strip, but it's worth every penny! If you're worried about cost check out the great lunch specials or the week night specials. Added bonus... hospitality focused staff!\n",

I wanted to take ordering slowly--so I could get situated in a new environment and to get quickly updated on 'the game.' Unfortunately I felt very rushed by the clerk. She was almost frantic in speech and allowed me little time to get oriented asking me to approach the counter when as soon as I entered. My guess is there's some godawful metric in use judging employees on speed. If so not cool. If so management should reconsider that; metrics lead to fraud, stressed employees, low quality, and in this case a customer whose first interaction was slightly negative. \n",

Like all other like places I have experienced the toppings are fresh, the sauce is decent, the crust is bland but inoffensive. The best I can say is that it has no soul. Whatever that means. You eat it, it is there, you leave and forget. There is no belly warmth to say you had a good meal, no slight dopamine reward, no serotonin kick. I am not sure what it is. It is somewhat an exaggeration what I am going to say next but the phrase is in the ballpark;  it seems like your everyday GMC, school lunch pizza just with better topping and sauce.

      "Message:  YbjQeRcUZk2csuV5THJzyA,Honestly this is one of my favorite restaurants near my apartment. The food is actually to die for and my hopes of weight loss die once I walk through the doors (though there are healthy options from what I've seen). I ordered the Big Floyd and holy smokes is it a good sandwich!  The fries were perfectly seasoned and from what my boyfriend said, the corn is also super delicious. There's a nice, but casual, atmosphere and the staff is super friendly and walks around the self seating tables to provide refills and take plates away. Great location as well! Right across the street from Guesthouse and other bars, so it is definitely worth going to after a drink or two (or anytime really).\n",

Dr. Gillaspie used an innovative device, called an Ellman Surgitron, that precisely and painlessly effaced my mole in a period of about 20 minutes.  Two weeks later, only smooth, pink, healthy skin remains.  Over time, the pink color will fade, and so will my memories of that unwanted mole.  Thank you, Dr. Gillaspie, for providing this service.

The young gentlemen recalled my name and when I explained to him I had try to call on numerous occasions with no response he informed me due to your Langley location being closed for renovations they have been overwhelmed and not have been able to respond to calls!

      "Message:  1yd3aNTqxmoYJt6RwkeJ0g,There isn't rating low enough for the Lack of Service Department at Clay Cooley Nissan. It is seriously one the worst post sale experiences I've had in my lifetime. I bought a Rogue in 2016 and it has been next to impossible to even speak to someone in the service department let alone get service. Same thing in September when I tried to get nitrogen in the tires. There for 15 minutes. No one even acknowledged me let alone spoke to me nor did anyone come out to speak to the eight people before me. The receptionist in the sales room was not helpful and what a surprise the general manager wasn't there. This is the same experience I've had with each of my past visits. No one answers the phone and if they do they say hold on let me transfer you to the correct person/department and then you are just left on an endlessly ringing line. If you get to leave a voice mail they don't call you back. The post sale experience has ensured I will never buy another Nissan from Clay Cooley and likely not at all. Interestingly when I left this review on facebook it didn't take the general manager more than twenty minutes to respond and offer help or at least he did so in a public comment. It remains unclear why you cant get that kind of response in person or on the phone. I'd drive to Dallas for an oil change before I'd step foot back in this dealership. I've since taken my Rogue to Town North Nissian. There is definite improvement in that they at least acknowledge you when you are physically there and they do answer the phone but even there my service rep didn't want to investigate the chirping/rattling from the hatch. It's as if the Nissan service team members are not aware that every interaction with them is shaping the customers decision as to whether or not to purchase another Nissan in the future. It's a shame because I like vehicle, minus the rattle at 10K miles.\n",

      "With the explorer. She Didn't floss them only one, she didn't clean them only 2, then put fluoride gel and said she's all set. She told me no cavities and Brush better with water!!! I said I brush twice a day with pea sized toothpaste. She said toothpaste is secondary it doesn't matter for a four year old. I said so how do you expect it to be clean then??? She needs a pea sized toothpaste. My daughter Literally sat In the chair for less than 2 minutes and the hygienist said your done Goodbye. I said excuse me?? I told her when you do a cleaning, first you have to take the X-rays then floss in between each tooth then clean each tooth meaning each surface of all the teeth then let her rinse and spit out then lastly you put the fluoride gel on. And make sure in between she doesn't swallow anything. Then she'll be all set. I made her do everything over. She said how do you know?? I said I'm in the dental field. Where??? I said tufts university pediatrics. I told her you did nothing for my daughter so I'm going to another dental office. She got scared and told me sit back down I didn't know you knew so much, sorry I didn't know you were in the dental field. If you weren't in the dental field you wouldn't have known I did nothing.. ugh!!! I said I am in the dental field that's why I'm so specific how to do the cleaning. and I made her do everything over. I said first floss, She yelled I did floss look at all the blood on the floss!!! I said what blood??  you flossed one tooth. Do it over please in all the teeth. She said with the same floss or different?? I said different. I said where's the dentist she said she's not here yet she takes a train in. Why you want to wait for her?? I said it would be nice to see a dentist. As I was leaving the dentist came in and looked at my daughters teeth and said great job mommy. You take great care of your daughters teeth. No cavities. I said I know thanks have a nice day dr. And left. I will never set foot in this office again. They care about getting the child in and out within 5 minutes and they care about only the money not the quality of the child's health. I will never recommend this office to anyone. Beware of them. It's toxic full of lazy staff. I never degrade anyone but come on, parents are really thinking there child's teeth are getting cleaned thoroughly and it's not. After me there was another child. As I walked out. The child walked out 2 minutes later. That means she got him in and out real quick. Greedy people. They are only hungry for money. They don't do their job right. They should be ashamed of themselves. I was so disappointed. I didn't leave until everything was done the right way. Every child deserves correct treatment. My daughter sits there listens is quiet and lets them do the cleaning. She doesn't cry or fuss. So what's the big deal doing the cleaning the right way. There's two words for them lazy and cheap.\n",

Anywho, this is an AYCE place and they have plenty of options on their menu. You can choose from edamame to egg drop soup to tuna roll to a KFC roll. Overall, I would rate their food 3 out of 5 stars. Their sushi is mediocre but honestly, everything else on the menu (excluding sushi) is pretty good. Their service, however, is pretty terrible. There were 2 servers picking up orders and delivering to guests. Majority of the time they were waiting until the sushi orders were completed so they can deliver. I didn't really like this since I was waiting for at least 15 minutes until someone attended to me again.\n",

      "OLD MAN RECORDS ME AT GOODLIFE SOVEREIGN METROTOWN, AND NOTHING WAS DONE THANKS TO BEN (CLUB MANAGER)\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 20th, I was working out at Goodlife Metrotown when a stranger approached me and told me that there was an older man (50-60 years old) recording me on his phone as he walked by. When he pointed to which man it was, I recognized him immediately. The old man has been acting strange around me since I joined the gym. For example, he would come very close to me and start exercising. Sometimes he would just stand near me and often walk close to me when it was unnecessary to do so. The man already had me feeling uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told the front desk staff including a personal trainer what had happened, and they assured me that they would take care of it and talk to the older man. Fast forward 10 days later and the man was still getting too close and acting weird. And when we asked if he had been talked to, the staff said no... I told my boyfriend what happened, so he approached the man and got into an altercation with him (no violence). One of the managers notified me that they reviewed the tapes, and found the moment when the old man walked by me, with his phone pointed directly at me. They even found the stranger who caught him, and they said that they would talk to him too. They made it appear that they had enough evidence to ban the old man. I thought I was safe to come back to the gym...\n",
      "\n",
      "But unfortunately, earlier today (November 30, 2017) my boyfriend and I were approached by the club manager, Ben. Ben said that he talked to the older man and he believed that the event didn't take place (despite video evidence, despite what his colleagues thought of the surveillance, and despite what the witness said). He said the video doesn't show any \"obvious\" filming and that he was siding with the older man. When I asked about the witness, Ben told me that he hasn't talked to the witness yet. He also told me that they would not be banning the old man, despite not talking to the witness. What's sickening is that he informed me that the older man feels uncomfortable at the gym because of my boyfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ben told us that to be able to continue training at Goodlife, we will have to remain civil with the old man. My stomach dropped as I heard that. I felt like I was slapped in the face. Called a liar. I felt like Ben was playing a cruel joke on me. I told Ben, right then and there, to cancel my membership. Instead of acting comforting, Ben didn't say anything, he just got up, walked to the computer and canceled my membership. The whole ordeal felt as if he was banning me; the girl who was recorded by a sick old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Ben. Guys like you are the reason women feel so uncomfortable at gyms. It took me years to finally set foot in the gym, and now I've been kicked out of one. I can't imagine how many times the old man filmed me in the past. And it makes me feel sick thinking about what he was doing with the videos. \n",

If you like ramen noodles from the little square package this is not the place for you. Here you will experience a broth that has been simmering to perfection for over 14 hours and tender fresh noodles.  There are a variety of flavors and levels of spice. My go to is the Spicy Miso Paitan Ramen.  If you like it really spicy you can easily ask for more hot oil on the side. This broth is rich, velvety and has a milky texture, you can literally see the richness. This bowl comes with Chinese mushrooms,corn ( I get extra),spring onion, a soft boiled egg and pork belly or tenderloin to accompany the wavy ramen noodles.  The best part is since they give you so much if you can't finish all your broth you can get an extra order of wavy noodle when they pack it up for you. Oh and you should definitely get some appetizers here they are all fantastic my go to is typically the crab taco and you should get extra pickles because they are amazing and made in house. Note this place is closed on Monday and no matter how much you end up loving it you can't get in on Monday and believe me I tried\n",

      "\n",
      "As stated on their website, all tickets are inclusive of your meal, beverage pairings, tax & tip.  At $65/person, dining at Tasting Counter was worth every penny.  You see your food prepared right before your eyes at a dining counter that seats up to 20, surrounding their prep kitchen where every dish is plated in front of you..  The venue also becomes a wine bar during certain non-tasting menu hours (Tuesdays 5pm-12:30am, Wed through Sat 10:30pm-12:30am) and no reservations are needed.  It is located near a brewery and a rock climbing gym.  The venue is very warm and inviting, with their wine collection on one side of the back wall, as well as their herb garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon getting seated, Chef Ungar personally introduced himself to everyone seated around the counter in two's or three's and explained their philosophy of \"0 carbon, 50 local, 100 natural\".  They strive toward a zero carbon footprint, sourcing at least 50% of their products from within the state of Massachusetts and serving all natural foods and wines.  The 5 course lunch menu was very well paired with beverages (I chose wine), with a mix of English, Asian, and French flavors.  The chef and sommelier were very descriptive with the food and beverage, and engage every guest.  Truly a wonderful find during my time in Boston.\n",

To his suprise, removing the clog was a bit more complicated than expected, he even stepped out a couple of times just to find the right tools in order to fix the issue. 4 hours later, he was able to remove the clog. He honored the price that was discussed at first (I was thinking he was going to bump it a bit since he ended up doing a lot more work than what he explained) and cleaned up after. They document their jobs using a software (very organized), they also accept any form of payment (cash, credit card, checks), and they have an option to send the invoice via email (a modern and convenient process). Jeremiah is a nice, polite, and professional person. I highly recommend these guys.\n",

Every person I've ever brought him here becomes obsessed and it has become a colt. This is the best place to come when you don't care about being sexy but you care about having fun and the reason it's all possible is because of the DJ. DJ T-Rexx is the best DJ and is the only DJ that will make it impossible for me to stop dancing until 2AM when I literally get kicked out because I won't stop dancing. He is the sole reason that this place is great. Whenever there is a DJ substituting him it's never fun. DJ T Rex will always listen to recommendations and make sure the night is a good night for all.
